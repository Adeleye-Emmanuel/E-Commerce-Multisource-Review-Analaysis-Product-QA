       "'Because people want it I can sell it. Put the phone in the trash as well. The only problem is that the trash can isn\\'t going to just spit up $1200.. I hold on to it for either storage for when I upgrade, or if I want to sell it.. I have 7 iPhone boxes Carter computers. what if i just like having it, carter?. Me with my 2 boxes full of apple boxes:. My dad got a 16+ because he have bad vision.. The Karen Manager saying “YoU NeEd OrIgInAl PaCkAgInG tO rEtUrN tHiS iPhone!”. what makes you think I need the new Iphone. And what happens when you need to return or trade it in for a newer model. I had seen one guy use the box as a phone case once 😂😂😂. If I want ro sell it I\\'ll just pit it in the box. I thought your trash can would be full with all of the boxes of airpods you\\'ve thrown out \\nanyways, if it\\'s like an accomplishment item or something that marks a new time like the 16 pro or the macbook, then sure keep it. U will need that box if u lose your phone. In my country the warranty is on the box soooo.... Do you guys not resell your phones?. My mom keeps it cuz \"what if we have to return the phone\". CARTER CAN I PLS HAVE THAT BOX I LOVE THEM SO MUCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. What about people who sell them after???. I keep it for the background. I got it cause I needed a new phone. Hey now.. I may need my iPhone 11 box and 15 pro max box sometime! Don’t forget my Apple Watch box.. or the box my MacBook charger came in.. could be useful!. I am 17 and it is my first phone :). With the phone inside. Then you go to samsung store and buy an actually good phone, and not overpriced shit. Look bud, I went from a 7 to a 16, I’m keeping this box. Buying a cell phone just because a slightly better one came out is wild bro. I learned this from sneaker culture: keeping the boxes can increase the value of items. My box collection is pretty massive.. What makes you think you need a new phone every year 😂. I use the box to store the phone in storage. what makes u think I bought an iPhone every year. I got mine because I had an offer to trade in my iPhone 7 for 16 Pro. Might aswell keep the phone in it when you toss it cus fk apple. Instruction to unclear threw my phone in it and now my phone is broken 😭😭😭. Cuz it’s fun to hold on to bro. As someone who doesn’t get a new iPhone every year, when I do get a new phone I get a lot more value off eBay then apple trade in… And on eBay some folk are willing to pay a lot more if the iPhone comes with the box. Yo carter, can i have a pc? 🙏🙏🙏. saving the box is the best part!!!. \"You see, I actually take care of my phones. That way, when it eventually comes time for me to get a new one, I still have the box it came in, and i can sell it.\" -Robin Nelson AKA John A. Emkay. I still have an iPhone 9 lol. I mean my 12 is still working fine. Instructions unclear left phone in garbage. What if I want to Return it…?. I have a 15 without the box because I\\'m a normal person. The 16 pro was the first apple my dad got. That’s a 10 dollar box or it can be a 300 dollar scam on eBay. Keep the box. I AINT THROWING IT AWAY NOOooo. Carter being a sentient apple fan:. Nope I do it for resell value. I\\'m keeping my box for the meantime, because the last iPhone I had was the 6s lol. I\\'m on the16 pro max. I have a collection im not just gonna trowu it. What if you were gifted a red iPhone 12 with out the box but then you get a iPhone 16 plus with the box and never ever had a iPhone box before do I still throw it away????????. Everyone knows he pulled it out of the trash after the video. Bro if i whont to sell the phone and i dont ave the box Is whorth les. Do NOT disrespect my iPhone 16 plus like that. Wait there is an iphone 16?😭. If you ever want to resell your iPhone, might want to keep the box. You’ll get more money if you have the box along with the phone.. No I refuse to do such a sin. I hate these kinds of people \\nAs a pre-owned iPhone seller😢. Actully you need it not for memmory but if it is stollen they need stuf like the imei. but in india we get more but if we have the box and we got the brick or it had one. The box is a cool collectors item. The box is a cool collectors item. how tf did I get the exact same video back to back?. I don’t need it. But i forgot where i hid the box so even if i wanted to i couldn’t throw it away.. NO DONT DO IT IT HAS WARRINTY. When I sell it second hand, I can sell it for more with the box Carter. Im not using the same phone repeatedly and I can sell for more with the Box. So Carter put the fries in the bag. My phone broke so we went to get a new phone and there was a deal for it I didn’t get a new phone for three years so I think I have a good reason. I am gonna resale it lil bro wtf. Don\\'t forget to put your iphone in the box. I was forced to listen to this for 30mins as my phone fell under my very narrow bed. Because not everyone can afford a new phone every other week so when they upgrade, they sell the old one and you can a better deal if you have the box. Also the box has important details like warranty stickers and IMEI numbers.. my shit ahh brain throwing the phone in with the box. You didn’t need that phone either. having the box increases resale value. I don’t know why I can’t get rid of that. What if I sell the phone?. I actually accidentally tore the box. Apple intelligence is completely indefensible. Not only they had nothing ready and made a scam to buy iPhone 16, but the few features that are available are a joke, useless and way behind competitors like Samsung and google. Not many YouTubers are talking abt this feature. But if u hold on your camera button it also brings up another photo mode but with ChatGPT say like u wanted to know what a certain thing is and u don’t know in the moment or sum u can use that feature it’ll tell what the thing is or it’ll even search it up on the web for u same with prices and everything idk if anyone knew abt that but yeah that’s also a thing with the new iPhone 16 pro max.. How can I download your wallpaper?. I have Samsung s25u. Yesterday I was trying to order glasses online and it was asking me for my prescription. I had a hand written prescription from my pervious eye doctor. The hand writing was very sloppy, and the prescription terms that the website was wanting were different then what was on my prescription. I wasn\\'t sure how to translate that. I scanned the hand written note in the regular camera app and asked my phone\\'s AI to translate the prescription. It was able to read the handwriting and translate everything to the correct terms in one step, and it was correct. I was amazed. Comments played with bought responses – Apple intelligence is absolute trash. I hate to say that, because I’m not actually just set on, hating; I’m just literally surprised at how bad Apple intelligences, so… Thanks for wasting all of our time. Ya if last one was muted u Might be 🔇 foe rest. honestly very disappointed with apples \"AI\" siri continues to be terrible and useless most of the time. When is apple going to get it together and have full computer use like claude. WE WANT TO TELL OUR PHONES WHAT TO DO. Emergency alert I’m hungry is crazy 😂. I don’t understand and I have a 16 Pro …… we have always had the option too type too Siri. What is the weather like in Berlin right now?. Google gemini, grammarly, do not disturb mode. All of these are already in android. I wanted to die first, then I saw this glowing animation, life got better.. Androids did all these without any AI years ago.. we need a iphone 16 chip for these enduring AI tasks. im an apple fan but dam i think im growing wool. Boandroid with gemini 1 year ago: haha. My dad has it. It is so cool. I wish I had it, but my phone doesn’t do that anymore, but I still love Apple.\\n🍎. Apple intelligence is so slow I wish I could use Gemini on iPhone. MARCH 2025 NOW AND STILL NO SIGN OF INTELLIGNECE. March 2025 and still I don’t have this in Portugal LOL. Why didn’t you say the delay of the new Siri that was promoted at WWDC last year. For real though- wtf wants to type to Siri?. My guy has the swasti car app 🤢. Bro mine doesn’t have Siri anymore. Wait does the siri glow thingy work on iphone 15??. My phone doesn’t have the glowing animation. What case do you have on your iPhone?. So this is what apple has been praising for all this time. I’m honestly disappointed. how 2 set up this color frame ?. Apple ai is a long ways away from being useful.. What case is that please tell. Omg u can type with siri! a feature that they had years ago…. More like make life harder 😂do not trust ai. If you have used One UI AI ever, these features are nothing for you. Glowing a new thing ..i miss s pen. None of these shit made my life way easier :)))). How is this shit gonna make my life easier, bro? That’s ridiculous Clickbait.. There is no intelligence in the new iPhone update on rest of the phone, which are came before 15. we’ve got all this and still my iPhone 16 Pro’s Siri can barely even tell me the hours of a nearby grocery store. It seems like Siri won’t remember last conversation like chat gpt. Day 2 of testing it. I could be wrong. I have all the apple devices and none of these features are going to help me in anyway. have no idea why theyre trying to shove AI down our throats… if you have even 1/2 a brain, you can do all the things it can do and probably better…. It should help a lot while i need to focus on my phone while crossing a crosswalk or while im driving.. I haven’t seen any intelligence yet. So basically a whole lot of nothing. Bro was actually making squid game season 3 irl💀. are the features that will make our life easier in the room with us. Someone let me took 5second of your life can I do Ai in EU on pro max. “I found this on the web”. Most people around the world 🌎 who have an iPhone have photos dating back as far as the YEAR 2023 ONLY. \"I didn\\'t respond to your text because Apple Intelligence said it was irrelevant\" will be a nice excuse. Will it be released to the iPhone 14 eventually?. I didn’t know edge lighting brought to you by Samsung in 2017 would be apples latest innovation. Hell we could have told them we did it already. Saved a lot of time . Edge lighting. Gtfoo. Let\\'s be honest that these ai stuff has nothing to do with us, majority of ordinary folk. It all just marketing. W europie to masz chuja nie Apple inteligence. Wife: emergency alert, I’m hungry!        \\nMe: then go cook bishhhhh. My ring camera: ‘There’s a person at your front door’ (5 notifications).\\n\\nApple intelligence: ‘There are 5 people at your front door.’\\nLooks like my door is hosting a party and forgot to invite me 🤣🤣. Am I the only one who thinks the new screen glow looks soo cheap😢. Samsung has that animation since the Galaxy S10 and it looked much cooler because of its curved screen. bought a new iphone 16 pro max but very disappointed that writing tool only works for a day and then ran into error, same with playground. btw i am in australia and it is australian version. I wish to Siri,   Ui was just only on the notch, not the full outer display. Apple intelligence is shit, I’ve got it. I am happy I had to buy such an expensive iPhone first just to use this apple intelligence it makes my life worth living 😂. When will iPhone 14 series get Apple inteligence?. is that all free !? or paid bec already chat gpt showing under limit. Why Writing tools are not available for our day to day use cases like in whatsapp?. This fuuuccckkkeddd your battery…!!! Thats it…!!!. I find it odd that my iPad Air 5 gen launched in MARCH 2022 updated IOS with Apple Intelligence option but my iPhone 14 launched 6 months later in SEP 2022 is not capable of using Apple Intelligence option. What’s up with that?. I am loving Gemini on my Samsung phone but have to admit feeling a bit jealous over the Siri animation. It looks soooo cool.. Siri barely answers our questions now lol.

I’m in the uk, I’m using an iPhone 16Plus. In camertsetting there’d there’s the option to set it to 12mp’s or 24mp’s. At the top of the screen next the live on & off there’s a setting that says HEIF MAX which you can turn on & off. What is this for & what does it mean?  Thank you. She looks like \\'Gina\\' from Brooklyn nine nine😅. I am sorry but the shortcut control is just plain dumb.. like just keep it at your first pg or something 😂. Nice job.  Nice video, very stylish and good content.  Keep up the good work.. This video proved the people who said the iPhone 16 doesn’t have any features nd its js the camera. ate thattt.. Informative. She says “actually” incessantly.  That word adds nothing to a sentence.. This was helpful. I just got a 16 plus from a 13. Thanks for the help. 7:33 I can’t find it in my iPhone 16 😭why 😭. Hi there… where is mirroring on the 16 ?\\nThanks. Your soo good guys plss sub for her. You click around the screen WAY too fast.. I dont have rcs on my ip16😢. Why I can\\'t find any of the options in my iphone16 😢???. IM GETTING ONE TOMORROW THATS WHY IM WATCHING. Please advise me \\nWhich phone is the best on 2025\\nI phone 16 \\nI phone 15 plus \\nSamsung Galaxy s 24 ultra. Just upgraded from iPhone 13 to a new iPhone 16 Plus. This lady is underrated, she is one of the best youtubers out there, her content is just perfect❤❤❤❤. Just got the ultramarine few days back and I love it ❤️. I bought one and I\\'m really disappointed by the display... It\\'s blurry and not clear. MY EYES START hurting 😢 the display of model 16 is very bad. I’m in love with your content. what kind of melody is playing at 2:54 ?. These are freaking awesome but my god are we getting lazier everyday.😂. The side camera button has way too many features that it’s confusing and hard to remember tbh, I’m about to just turn it off.. I cant get the volume control to work on fb videos, it will not turn the volume up or down. probably just me. But I find the camera control difficult to use. Sure, press and take a pic but using the other controls is a pain requiring a precise touch.. before i watched it i already set camera control to double click,coz  i always accidentally click the side button. 9:49 Yk what else is massive. Why is there no vivid filter while clicking pictures. Watching this video on iPhone 16 ultramarine. Best decision to get it upgrade from iPhone 11. So many cool features . Eye 👁️ control was so good .. Just got the 16plus today and can’t find the eye tracking ??. After 10+ years of owning the 8 plus I’ve finally upgraded & this was very helpful indeed! The eye control blew my mind! 🤯🔥🔥. Would be very helpful if he was a little bit slower when flicking through the different controls. thank u now me and my family knows how to use aour iphones 16s 😃. ive been looking to buy and iphone 16 after a year of using a pixel 8. tbh i didnt know iphones have this much  features until i watch this video. thnks.will get one soon. We dnt have messages feature that u had shown i have 16 plus but dnt have these messages features that u have showed.. I love this phone I got the pink iPhone 16 plus I’m a happy customer I was a android user for awhile best purchase ever. Just got the 16. Thanks for the info. 😊. I don’t have that hide distracting item option. Where do I download Japanese lantern wallpaper? @anybody help?. I am saving this when I get my iPhone in 2 day I am watching it again. Wait so basically you can modify the stiffness of the camera button like the touch ID on old iphones?. Nice iPhone is finally getting closer to the androids from 5 years ago. Greatest tech video have ever seen💯. Thanks I really enjoyed the video and learned a lot. Thanks a million … almost 3 million 😊. I just got my iphone 16+ in the teal color. I love it❤. 7:52 I don’t see that button. Getting mine in 2 weeks I can’t wait 🥰. I have the iPhone 13, is it worth upgrading to the 16? What are the pros and cons of the iPhone 16? (besides the price 😂😭). Tham you are good ❤ i love your explaning on everyting. i finally just got a new phone and its the iphone 16!!. I think using your two fingers to zoom the camera is still easier than the new camera side button.. Fantastic video.  You’ll easily hit 3m, probably 6, you’re the best.. For me it’s either 24 or 48 but probably cuz I hav ethe plus. That hide distractions on the webpage is really semi useless I think.. its not like you are going to search for something, then go into a webpage and scroll and hide it all BEFORE reading the content, then the “hide distraction” actually BECOMES the distraction… and if you are reading and come across something, it doesn’t matter at that point because you are already past it… only thing I can see that being good for is if you need to screenshot something on the page and removing those distractions can tighten up the page a little to get more in the S.Shot.. but not enough to be useful…. Rcs messaging not showing on my phone any solution?. Where can I get that Polaroid wall paper. 2:22 you can set the button to open any app with a large portion of camera functionality. I have iPhone 16 and these changes are not impressive at all. I got it only because my other was old and not working properly so I had to move and decided to get the latest to be on the go for more years. I wish Siri was better like doing Within app works with YouTube especially. I don\\'t see an option of RCS messaging ... What should I do ??. I actually don’t have that RCS messages feature iphone 16😢. That was fun. Learned some cool stuff. My regular charge in 45 min   2 hours is craaazy. Going to get the I phone 16 plus. \"color intensity\" is more properly called \"saturation\". Please help me I am  getting YouTube notification “without sound”  even after all notifications settings are on  only silent noticatins I get on screen  focus is off  so what is d reason how  to get YouTube notification with sound. I have three iPhones, and all of them have this issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing is accidentally pressing the button—which can happen or not. But it\\'s a completely different matter to give Apple a pass for this bug on their new button.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s funny because a few days ago, another YouTuber called it out, and while testing it, found the issue himself. Then he changed his argument.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can argue that pressing and scrolling might not be common, but calling me a liar for showing a problem that occurs on all three of my iPhones seems disingenuous.. This must have gotten fixed now cause I can’t replicate it.. Yeah iv had the pro max for a week now and not once have I accidentally pressed it. Yeah it may just be yours because mine is the 16 teal and it works fine and I can scroll. Honestly ik the camera control button seems like a useless feature but it’s not all bad, it’s built in below the side of the phone so ur not accidentally clicking it, it’s a faster way of accessing the camera, and it’s an easier way of zooming in without taking ur hand off the phone to zoom in using the screen with ur fingers. My iPhone 16 Pro doesn’t do it when I put my finger on the camera button. He is a liar I have the iPhone 16 and that dose NOT happen. Its a fake  its not problem you can touch camera control and chenging window and using the app 👍🏼🤌🏼. i actually just got one, the problem is fixed. The move your hand, it’s not that hard. Then get yourself a case and stop crying. Sometimes it happens when phone is in my pocket. Not in a pro max version. Nah it doesn’t press easily unless you press it on purpose. Dahhhh. As a left handed person, I finally win. I’ve had the iPhone for three days now and I use it my right hand and I haven’t turned on the camera yet.. Dont have faking vivid on default camera filters 😖😖😖. I have a iPhone 16 and it doesn’t happen to me. Idk but maybe it is only in the pro models. My iPhone 16 is working fine. Even when I press the camera button 😅. Whining and bitching has to be the top pastime in this generation of adults.. Commenting after bought an 16pro in 24hr, yes sometimes it got that lag but most of the times it works. What variant are you using US?. Fake news this never happened to me. Fake when I touch side bar there is no problem in my screen it is movable 😊\\n\\nEdit: iPhone 16 regular 😮. Is not an issue… 😂 it’s a really good idea when you are using your camera. Bro u need to press two time i have the iphone 16 gi learn bro. Big PROBLEM IS OBVIOUSLY YA MENTAL ❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️🙅\\u200d♂️😝👻👻👻🤪🤪🤪. I updated my iPhone 16 Pro Max to iOS 18.3.1, and since then, whenever I receive a call on my mobile, the screen goes black. I reset the settings and reset the mobile. Many people said that updating to iOS 18.3.2 will not cause any problems. Now I updated to iOS 18.4, but the problem remains. What is the solution? 😅. i have no problem with it so it\\'s your problem not iphone 😂. bro it’s fake bc mine doesn’t do that. I also have a iPhone 16 and this doesn’t apply to mine. Hey dummy stop holding the button duh😂😂😂😂😂. my dads iphone 16 dont do that. just got mine it works fine. My iphone 16 pro doesn’t have this issue. But the 16e is not bad bcz the 16e does not have that issue. how about we don\\'t press the phone sides not to hard how about we try that?. You can deactivate the camera it. cap\\ni just got one and tried this and notyhing happens. Just get a phone case to help out 😂. No. If i press the camera button and hold it, touch screen working. iPhone 16Pro. Hahahah check your device bro. Mine is working flawless. Not a big problem.  I have a thin case on mine and can’t even reproduce what is being described with normal handling and operation of the phone.. What bullshit, cry me a river.. Lol mine never has a problem even when I accidentally presses that button, it just put my screen on camera lol. My 16 pro Max don’t have this problem.. Can you reply me how to turn off always on display in iphone16. I’m left handed. So no issue here. And I thought the design favours the right handed people.. Any solution for lens flair problem while night time photography??. I just got my iPhone 16 today. I do not have this problem and I even testesd it out. This is cap🧢. This is fake news \\nMine is working perfectly fine. I just purchased my 16 last week and in fact dose NOT  have this problem!. Fake news guys, I can\\'t reproduce this, I just got the phone a few days ago.. I just tried this and it didn’t do what you claimed. you can set it to double click to open the camera, i set mine to double click so that if ever i accidentally click the button nothing will happen 😊 thanks me later 😅. Its fake news… bcz mine is working fine 😅. I just bought it and there is not even single problem like this. Mine is 16 and there’s no such issue bro. My phone 16 pro in denmark does not have this problem. But I also just bought it. You can change the setting to Double Click to fix that problem.. Mine it’s still working after pressing the button. My 16 doesn’t do that it works perfectly fine. Just get a case bro\\nEasy. The other problem it has when zooming using the camera, it jumps when it goes from one camera to the other, making it not seamless. Anyone else?. I didnt even notice my phone had that button until this video popped up hahah. well... my pro version does not exhibit this issue. this never happened to me. LOL. Typical clickbait. 1. This is not true at all. That part of the screen works normally even when I press the button, 2. It will take a lot of pressure to accidently fully press the button in the first place - the thumb’s mound is not enough to click it.. That’s why you have a protector case around your phone It sets the button a little deeper I haven’t had this problem as when first put in the case And I’m not rich enough even with the protection plan to get another phone or go without for several days. Tell me which is better for the camera:\\n\\nA button for taking pictures (16 Pro and Pro Max) \\nOR\\nTwo seperate telephoto lenses for 3x and 5x and a 200MP with ability to record 8k video and way better AI photo editing features (S25 Ultra). I recently switched to A 16 Pro after trading in my 12 mini for a Verizon internet plan it made a big difference\\n1:I finally don’t need to carry around a charger anymore.\\n2:I can take better pictures:D\\n3:better gaming performance since my 12 mini always lacked a bit of power \\nI love the 16 Pro. The notification lol the school group cat be like 😭💀. I’m not interested in “extended warranty” dude stop harassing me. Exciting ❌ crazy ❌ overhyped ✅ I’m happy and stay with my rock’in IPHONE 15 Pro. This is not happening in mine one. Isme video call kar sakte hai kya?. One homie to another what\\'s your wallpaper. brightness goes to 1 nit my macbook goes plane black😂. Is nobody gonna talk about how he has 103 notifications on text messages and 46,498 notifications on Mail. You’re English sucks 😂 \\nEverybody know that shits😅. That\\'s not crazy at all 😂. This tech comes in my phone which is 30k and 15k 🤣🤣. Just switched to the iPhone 16 Pro Max this week after using Android for almost 10 years, and honestly, I didn’t expect to like it this much. I got it mostly for work stuff—camera, battery life, and the new AI voice notes feature—but now I’m kinda hooked on everything else. The screen is insanely smooth, and the phone somehow feels lighter than my old Pixel even though it\\'s bigger. Took some getting used to, but the build quality is wild. The camera is definitely the highlight for me. I took some low-light shots at a concert two nights ago and didn’t even have to tweak anything—looked clean right out of the gallery. Battery life also surprised me. I’ve been using it non-stop for email, video, and Reddit, and I still end most days at around 35%. I downloaded ProtonVPN right away (still one of the best free VPNs in my opinion) since I use public Wi-Fi a lot, and it runs smooth in the background without killing performance. I saw some mixed reviews about overheating or bugs, but so far I haven’t had any of that. Coming from someone who used to read free VPN Reddit threads like a hobby, the transition to iOS has been way less painful than I thought. Curious what other first-time Apple users think of the new 16 Pro Max—did it live up to the hype for you?. I picked up the latest iPhone SE earlier this week because I needed a backup phone for work, and honestly, I’m pretty surprised by how good it feels. I’ve been using a 14 Pro Max as my main phone, so I was expecting the SE to feel cheap or super slow, but it’s actually holding up way better than I thought. It’s super light, easy to use one-handed, and the Touch ID honestly feels refreshing after using Face ID for so long. Apps open quickly, the camera is decent for casual shots, and the battery life has been enough to get me through a full workday without stressing. I’ve been using it mostly for emails, calls, and even some YouTube during downtime, and it hasn’t lagged once. I did throw a free VPN on it too (Windscribe from my old free VPN Reddit setup) just to stay safe on random Wi-Fi networks, and it ran perfectly fine without slowing the phone down. It’s not a flashy phone, but if you just need something simple, fast, and solid, it’s way better than I expected for the price. Anyone else using the new SE? Curious if it holds up long-term or if it starts feeling slow after a few iOS updates like the older models used to.. Dropped my iPhone 16 Pro the other day and it face-planted right on gravel. I had a Spigen on it at first and, of course, it cracked. Not shocking.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBut when I switched to the ESR Armorite protector next? It just got a tiny nick, barely noticeable. (Yes, I know. I dropped it again, I\\'m THAT clumsy lmao send help)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Armorite does feel a little less slippery than the Spigen, but honestly, I’m fine with that. After seeing how much damage the Spigen took, I’ll take a bit of extra grip.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnyone else find that some of these protectors actually hold up better than you\\'d expect?\\n\\n. I got pushed around by Comcast yesterday. They can do what they want, since I have no other options. http://youtu.be/PRLgG9ctZGg\\n[](http://youtu.be/PRLgG9ctZGg)\\n\\nEDIT: I\\'m glad this is getting some attention. Last night I sent the video to We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com and\\necare@comcast.com , as well as the tips address for the Consumerist. Today I submitted an FCC complaint per the suggestion of /u/BarbwireCake. I\\'ve only received an automated response from Comcast so far. Some are suggesting that a class action lawsuit might be a catalyst for change; I\\'m not sure. I will update when I hear from someone.\\n(12:17PST)\\nFiled with BBB and posted to [twitter](https://twitter.com/Sweetlethargy/status/550033447729643520)\\n(13:04PST)\\n\\nEDIT:\\nI spoke with someone from Comcast Executive Customer Relations. He wanted to discuss my complaint, but refused to be recorded. I record all of my calls with creditors so that I won\\'t be promised something that is never delivered. As I found out yesterday, it might not even matter if the call has been recorded. Luckily this thread got some attention today, so I might actually get help with this issue. He assured me that I would change my mind about Comcast after speaking with him but I declined to continue the conversation. I\\'ve obviously learned my lesson today about keeping accurate records, and I don\\'t want to hear anymore crocodile tears or pseudo-promises.\\nIn any case, he said he would email me details of our non-conversation, which I will place here:\\n\\n--\\nHello /u/sweetlethargy, I regret not being able to consent to your recording our conversation due to  the nature of the reasons or possible intent that you may have for the recording. In reviewing the original and unedited version of your initial call, the agent gave you correct information on the service plan and promotional services at the time of the call. This is the product and service that you spoke about:\\n\\nInternet Plus 09/06 - 10/05 69.95\\n\\nIncludes Limited Basic, HBO, Streampix, a\\nStandard Definition Digital Converter and\\nRemote For The Primary Outlet, and\\nPerformance Internet.\\n\\nService Discount -19.96\\n\\nTotal XFINITY TV $49.99 plus taxes and fees\\n\\nFranchise Fee 1.42\\n\\nUtility Tax 2.00\\n\\nPEG Access Support 0.28\\n\\nState Sales Tax 0.16\\n\\nFCC User Fee 0.09\\n\\nTotal Taxes, Surcharges & Fees $3.95 (these vary slightly per month and are only collected by Comcast)\\n \\nDocsis 3 Owned Mdm 09/06 - 10/05 0.00\\n\\nBlast! Internet Svc 09/06 - 10/05 11.00\\n\\nService Discount -11.00\\n\\nTotal XFINITY Internet $0.00 (this was added after your conversation with the agent as a bonus) which may have caused this confusion\\n\\nWe have extended this promotional offer as a gesture of good will for an additional 12 months as long as you understand that at the end of that term if you wish to keep it, it will be billed at its standard rate.\\n--\\n\\nIt seems that they aren\\'t accepting responsibility for anything, but they are offering me something. Here is my response. (All I want is what I was quoted):\\n\\n--\\nBottom line: do I have 100mbps down, 25mbps up, no contract, at $53.85 total per month including taxes and all other fees for 12 months?\\n--\\n\\nIm waiting for a response.\\n\\nFor people who were asking, I used the android app Automatic Call Recorder by Appliqato. Everyone should record conversations with their creditors to keep them accountable.\\n(18:24PST)\\n\\n**FINAL UPDATE:**\\n\\nJust spoke with an \"Executive Customer Relations Supervisor\" who apologized for the actions of the two customer retention reps, as well as the Executive Customer Relations rep who refused to be recorded yesterday. She was very polite, took full responsibility for Comcast\\'s mistakes, and allowed me to record our conversation. She explained that \"both representatives you reached were freshly out of a training class\" and they \"should\\'ve placed you on hold\" to get more information. This is strange, since I could clearly hear the second rep being coached on what to say... \\n\\nIn any case, the Executive Customer Relations Supervisor said she would credit me a month of service as a sign of good will. She also explained that I would be receiving the promotional rate through August 15th 2015, however, due to the fluctuation of taxes and fees, she could not guarantee my final cost of $53.85. This month the final cost would be $55.55, for example. I indicated that all I wanted was the out-the-door $53.85 cost that I was quoted in August. I agree that the dollar amount is negligable, but all I\\'ve wanted is the price I was quoted when I agreed to keep the service. She agreed to credit my account $5 every month so that at no time I would be expected to pay more than $53.85.\\n\\nToday I Learned that if Comcast pushes you around, the best course of action is to expose them on social media. I can honestly say that this has been easier, less time consuming, and less stressful to make and post the video than it would\\'ve been to dial 1-800-COMCAST again. I hope these Comcast horror stories continue to get posted so that something might change one day. Proper competition is the only answer to this solution, and I personally feel that public utilies should also operate as ISPs.\\n\\nEveryone should be recording their interactions with creditors, as it is obviously the only way to keep them (somewhat) honest. It\\'s sad that I was granted my simple request only after my video had been posted to the Consumerist, Techdirt, BGR, Gawker, yahoo, etc, etc... I realize that most people will simply never receive help with their complaints.\\n\\nGood luck to all of you who are dealing with similar situations.\\n\\n**tldr; I\\'m now getting what I was quoted: 100mbps down, 25mbps up, through August 15th, no contract, for no more than $53.85 per month.**\\n\\n(12/31/2014 11:08PST)\\n. **UPDATE: There appears to be a problem with the update thread. Here is the direct link to the youtube video showing the result-** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P9WIfGyX-Q&feature=youtu.be\\n\\nUPDATE: You can find the update here- http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2gixp7/updatetime_warner_is_already_terrible_despite_a/\\n\\nHaving seen many terrible recordings with Comcast I figured it wouldn\\'t be a bad idea to record my own interaction to have a backup of what I was being told. \\n\\nI was transferred something like eight or nine times, sent to the business class department voicemail for some reason, told to stop recording by a supervisor (who had no answers and told me some...ridiculous things) told opposing things by different reps, and ultimately had a rep admit the letter I was sent was a lie. \\n\\nHere is a copy of the letter they sent me- http://imgur.com/6Uttmkq\\n\\nThey ultimately told me to call back to the customer help desk tomorrow, right after the last person tells me the letter is wrong. If anyone ends up caring I will post an update.\\n\\nHere is the interaction if you would like to see it- Time Warner and Their Crap: http://youtu.be/Xg3IhBraxLM\\n\\nTL;DR: Time Warner lied in their promotional mailing. A representative admits that to me after being transferred to nine different people who don\\'t know what the hell they are talking about, one being a supervisor who gets a little feisty about being recorded.\\n\\nEDIT 2: The timeline of the video for those interested in skipping about-\\n\\n01:26- Terrence gets on the phone and confirms the package for me. Has to transfer me because it lowers my bill.\\n\\n02:30- PKE boredom.\\n\\n02:40- The words come out of Terrence\\'s mouth.\\n\\n03:24- Transferred to Tiara. She denies what Terrence said.\\n\\n06:22- Tiara wants to confirm with a supervisor.\\n\\n07:23- I ask to be transferred to a supervisor. Mr. Feisty cometh. He gets mad that I am recording.\\n\\n11:50- Mr. Feisty transfers me again.\\n\\n11:55- Cynthia picks up.\\n\\n12:53- My phone runs out of space and I start recording on my desktop.\\n\\n16:51- Transferred to someone who does not identify themselves.\\n\\n20:27- Nameless says she will transfer me to a \\'specialist\\'.\\n\\n20:33- I find out that I am being transferred to the business class line for some reason. It directs me to a voicemail which tells me to leave a message after the tone. There is no tone.\\n\\n21:08- I put a shirt on and call back.\\n\\n21:13- Emily picks up. I explain how I\\'ve been bounced around and, essentially, hung up on. \\n\\n23:39- Emily tells me that I don\\'t have to worry about anyone misspeaking or anything because they too are recording all calls. \\n\\n25:04- I try to tell Emily that the letter says it is to add TV to my internet service, not about starting new service. She understands. So she says.\\n\\n25:30- She refers to the fine print possibly saying that it is for new service. Here is a picture of the fine print- http://i.imgur.com/f2Xnm30.jpg\\n\\n26:10- Transferred to Ricardo, who asks me for an EID number. Tells me I was accidentally transferred to an \\'internal department\\'.\\n\\n30:47- Ricardo informs me he is going to transfer me again, but with the catch that he is going to explain it to them that I do qualify for the package on the flyer.\\n\\n31:28- Ricardo comes back to tell me that I actually don\\'t qualify for the package on the flyer.\\n\\n32:43- I confirm with Ricardo that the letter I was sent was not correct. He says that is true.\\n\\n33:05- I repeat myself and have him confirm what he just said.\\n\\n35:10- Ricardo tells me to call back to customer care on monday/tomorrow.\\n\\n35:59- Ricardo is saying goodbye, and starts laughing for some reason. My final thoughts follow after.\\n\\n\\n. Hello everyone,\\n\\nI often see flamewars on this site about the topic of adblocking, often publishers v. users and thought I could chip in my two cents to bring up another angle: An operational/administrative one. This post may be long, but has been several days in the making.\\n\\nTo run a successful international communications infrastructure, be it radio, Internet, phone, or whatever there needs to be operational cooperation among all stakeholders to keep the infrastructure and all of its endpoints healthy. Communication systems are almost constantly operated on the precipice of destruction due to the precarious nature of having everyone\\'s cooperation in ensuring that health.\\n\\nThe key issue is that a huge number of publishers and those in advertisement approach the Internet as a publication platform and data farm — a simple vehicle, not a multi-stakeholder communications infrastructure. They don\\'t see an operational angle to what they\\'re doing, just design, content, products, services and business. They just see the Internet as a vehicle to their end goal of getting their content out there and income flowing through advertisements. Doing so in an operationally responsible manner just isn\\'t in their sights.\\n\\nThis is why radio communications has such strict licensing requirements because it is known that those who simply use it as a vehicle  would be negligent to the point it would become abuse and trample upon carefully engineered standards. Internet publishing and advertising proves that licensing correct for existing. It proves publishers and advertisement industry can\\'t be left to their own devices to be responsible.\\n\\nThe Internet also has a mechanism to deal with negligence and abuse: Filters.\\n\\nFrom the advent of the Internet, even before the web as a publication medium was a glimmer, there has always been selective filtering of traffic. Filtering can take place in the form of firewalls, routing rules, filtering proxy servers, mail/spam filters, killfiles, ban lists, access control lists (ACLs), and a multitude of other manners including ad blockers. It\\'s how the Internet community seeks to regulate and marginalize bad behavior and seek to correct that behavior or at minimum reduce the impact.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the Internet has three unwritten operational core tenets: Stability, Security and Accountability centering around an element of Trust. If you end up in someone\\'s filters, chances are, something you did violated at least one of the three and damaged others\\' trust in you. \\n\\nIf you dig in your heels and **refuse to cooperate with the community and that causes you to lose money in doing so, the Internet\\'s internal methods of correcting bad behavior are working**. Legitimate mail server operators who are on spammer blacklists are losing money too, but they don\\'t get the special treatment that publishers feel entitled to. Everyone needs to follow the same processes to earn trust and mend it after it is broken.\\n\\nPublishers and AdTech companies, we need to talk:\\n\\nYou have broken everyone\\'s trust in you and now you need to mend it. Stop side-stepping, stop talking about revenue. It\\'s been talked about to death — we know you need revenue, but you need to respect the community.\\n\\nThe community has **begged and pleaded with you to fix issues**. Yet you chronically ignore these issues and treat them as non-existent because fixing them involves change.\\n\\nYou\\'re not the only one on the Internet who gets filtered but you are making the biggest, most public scene about it. As I said, mail servers end up on blacklists all the time and lose money the longer they are filtered. Normally the operators of those servers are able to simmer their anger and contact those who blacklisted them to discuss how things can be fixed or contact mailing lists and forums for advice. **Don\\'t lament on how \"greedy\" your users are and how they are stealing from you, your hands aren\\'t clean enough to lament about that**.\\n\\nLet me **plead** with you again with issues I\\'ve compiled from this site and other sources, excuse any overlap as some issues are complex and multi-part and some of these points bring up different angles, in no particular order:\\n\\n1. Can your terms of service, privacy policy documents, contact and help sections be accessed without any third party involvement, advertisements, tracking or volunteering information? If not, why not? \\n2. Front-line services like your publications among others often anonymize third parties in your Terms of Service with phrases like \"Third Party Partners\", \"Associates\", \"Contractors\" or the like and people cannot make knowledgeable consent with that anonymization in place. Why can\\'t people know who these third parties are in full detail with contact information.. addresses, email addresses, phone numbers (to actual people who work there) should they have concerns?\\n3. Advertising, marketing and data mining is collectively a clandestine, opaque collective of middlemen upon middlemen. How can the community trust these massive networks of \"John Does 1 through ~30,000,000\" that we don\\'t even know?\\n4. Advertising, marketing and data mining isn\\'t compartmentalized enough. This is why I said \"John Does 1 through ~30,000,000\". Once you share data with one party in advertising/marketing, you don\\'t know who else will have access to that data or how. How can this obscure network of businesses be trusted if the travel of personal information can\\'t be limited to a given scope and have that scope be known?\\n5. AdTech works only from a \"big picture\" perspective, Google and Facebook being the prime examples of this. They work based on mass-statistics, details are rendered irrelevant. They operate from an altitude where the Grand Canyon is a mere scratch. How can we trust a big picture data-driven industry to respect individual choice and not to simply render it irrelevant in their quest for becoming ubiquitous?\\n6. In tandem with that \"big picture\" perspective, AdTech tends not to care about malicious advertisements trying to push malware, scams and abusive code in general. They are often played off as \"minor incidents\" simply because statistically they aren\\'t the majority of ads. How can the public trust ads at all if they are processed through organizations that aren\\'t accountable or secure for the minority because \"it\\'s insignificant\"? It\\'s like a police department saying since the majority of people aren\\'t murdering that murder is irrelevant and practicing street safety is \"being paranoid\".\\n7. Advertisements don\\'t seem to be about informing anymore, but rather be about psychological exploitation and a \"legitimized\" form of stalking. Have you considered that people feel personally under attack and unsafe around anything to do with AdTech? Have you considered  that people may feel that their computers are under constant attack in the quest for tracking and exploitation from unknown parties? Consider how the New York Times the had a partner that was actively using a WebRTC exploit. How can we trust that you aren\\'t doing the same?\\n8. Bloated advertisements that use heavy Flash, Javascript or HTML5 advanced features can cause stability issues for people with lower-end computers and devices. As the \"Internet Is For Everyone\" RFC 3271 highlights, the Internet should be made accessible for everyone. Some people who are on fixed income can\\'t gain access to the devices you target your sites/ads for. Why can\\'t you be more forgiving?\\n9. Websites have naturally become more complex over time. However the amount of different components your website references and asks people\\'s computers to download and execute automatically without being asked without prior disclosure or option is definitely concerning. You\\'re asking people to sign a blank cheque to trust it all and allow any and all code to run unquestioned without first being allowed to inspect your \"product\" with all of its attachments for defects first. \"My website can\\'t possibly do anything wrong\" is an unacceptable response.\\n10. You\\'re asking people to transfer secondary content from your server they may not even want like your autoplaying videos attached to text articles — making it a pointless expense for not only your users, but yourself and other service operators too (who like you also have bills to pay). Why insist on making things pointlessly expensive for everyone?\\n11. By having posted third party elements on your website without their contact information for operational concerns, you are announcing that you want the buck to stop with you should accountability be required and are further announcing that you have control over the servers your those elements are served from to fix any problems.\\n12. The Internet has many massive hierachial systems with multiple tiers like DNS, IP address allocations and routing databases where there is accountability at all levels and the \"who\\'s who\" of operations is public. There\\'s no reason why the web should be an exception except but to avoid accountability. Can we \"whois\" an advertisement to discover the chain of custody? Why not?\\n13. AdTech routinely moves to work around filters much like spammers routinely do. How are you any better than spammers in not addressing why you are filtered?\\n14. Many advertisements exceed the data size of the actual media or content being accessed. It\\'s in no way proportional. How is this acceptable in a day and age where metered Internet connections are becoming more and more prevalent? \\n15. With Youtube in particular among other video streaming service, if the video streaming experience is incomplete and it stops transferring due to packet loss or another network condition, users are often required to watch another advertisement to reload just to continue your singluar experience. It\\'s understandable from a technical perspective why this happens, and may bring more income but it\\'s wasteful and borderline abusive to people\\'s data transfer to transfer yet another advertisement since you already have your revenue on the original view that wasn\\'t completed.\\n16. Often times you run inefficient content infrastructure because it \"takes too much time\" to do things right and you feel it takes away from your business. Ergo your servers are working harder and doing less than if you were to correctly set up with appropreate caching. To put a point to this, I wager if you were in charge of Wikipedia, you\\'d make it require at least an entire Google or Amazon-scale  datacenter and require the appropriate ad revenue to cover it all. Why make your infrastructure cost so much to run with so little return?\\n17. People often do not subscribe to your websites because they see all kinds of services getting compromised and feel that perhaps with your inattention to operational and security concerns, that you may be foolish with their personal information and you may get their information stolen and when that happens you\\'ll just say \"Oops\".\\n18. People often do not subscribe because likewise they may feel you don\\'t want them to subscribe because you don\\'t make it a valuable thing to have. Many online newspapers often don\\'t remove their ads for subscribers for instance, wanting to double-dip. This is unacceptable.\\n19. Some sites completely reject the notion at all of subscription because it makes their users actual customers they have to listen to as opposed to \"mere users\" who can be pushed around with errant Terms of Service updates that seek to strip those users of rights. Your only customers and the only people you deem it acceptable to be accountable to are your advertisement partners.\\n20. Your collective opaqueness has given rise to those scammers who run sites that can look structurally legitimate, but are in fact abusive ad/link farms that in fact take money away from legitimate businesses like you.\\n21. Some advertisements can make websites completely inaccessible or unusable. For instance on mobile devices some ads proceed to abuse the notification/vibration functionality and/or cause forced redirects. Often if there are redirects, they force the device to open the app store offering an app unrelated to the site, while the user has been obstructed from their intent. This prevents the user from browsing the site and makes the user question the legitimacy, reputation and security of the website.\\n22. Some ads attempt to impersonate system notifications in an attempt to elicit users to download and install programs that they may not in fact need and may in fact be malicious. There\\'s no valid reason for an ad to appear to originate from an operating system, even if they are from an operating system vendor. \\n\\nLeaving my address to you in closing,\\n\\nIt\\'s no wonder publishers and AdTech companies aren\\'t trusted and as such are filtered. They don\\'t seek trust, they seek to \"own\" \"their\" printing press and data farm that the Internet is to them. Filtration is inconvenient as it reminds them that they don\\'t own it and need to respect others.\\n\\nThe Internet is not a printing press nor a data farm, it\\'s a living, breathing complex network of networks governed by its participants that needs care in its operation. Everyone needs to do their part in that operation. That includes publishers who need to step up and start caring and addressing concerns with more than just \"Users are greedy and are stealing from us!\"\\n\\nWithout that care publishers and AdTech operators become like the cheap \"Internet of Things\" manufacturers who create cheap, substandard products that gave rise to the Mirai botnet. The same attitude that made their own or their colleague\\'s sites unavailable with the Dyn attack. While those manufacturers can claim \"We didn\\'t do that\", they are indeed part of the contribution to the Mirai botnet, and likewise publishers are a part of the security and accountability problem the Internet faces as they contribute to it with self-serving practices.\\n\\nThe community is trying to prevent that destabilization by blocking the unaccountable, unstable, opaque ads since publishers and AdTech companies are intent on not addressing operational and privacy concerns. It is unacceptable that publishers, advertisers, data mining companies, advertisement networks, social networks and whomever else is trying to side-step the tenets that make the network great. Terms of service don\\'t trump those tenets and it\\'s fully in everyone\\'s right to moderate exploitative behavior.\\n\\nPublishers, AdTech and their partners: You\\'ve created this problem. Everyone else has been sitting at the table patiently waiting for you to show up, but you\\'ve been in the hallway throwing a temper tantrum about \"your revenue\", so we\\'ve held the meeting without you and ad-blockers and the like are the result. We\\'ve held many discussions since and every time your reaction has been the same. Can you actually come to the table and be civil?. **update!** I wasn\\'t able to speak before a committee/body today, [but I did join a team of tech folks lobbying senators, representatives, and their staffs all day today in Washington](https://plus.google.com/113164038788726940319/posts/ab9eFgmovJ1).

I told my story, and how in a ProtectIP world it simply couldn\\'t have happened. We all want to stop the bad guys, but doing *this* would obliterate one of the few growing sectors of our economy (one that we\\'re also out-innovating the rest of the world in) and ruin the beautiful meritocracy that is the world wide web.\\n\\nI hope I did you all justice and though I didn\\'t sleep much last night, you all were instrumental in helping craft what I\\'d say and how I\\'d say it.

Suggestions?\\n\\nedit: Thank you for all the feedback & encouragement! ~~Aw hell, a few of you suggested I create a public google doc -- here it is!~~ (Shut it down because we can\\'t have nice things.). Hi folks, \\n\\nIn light of the ongoing world-wide cyberattack/ransomware issue at the moment, we have decided to set up a mega-thread to contain all of the news and updates as things unfold.

Even though I had already tried 15 times to get Comcast to address my non-working service, Comcast employees Ashley on 6/24/14 and Melissa on 7/4/14 insisted that if I cancelled my account, I would be charged a $960 Termination Fee.  At the time, I didn’t know that Ashley and Melissa were actually “Retention Agents”, expertly trained to carry out Comcast’s evil-genius *Refuse-To-Let-Customers-Cancel* scheme by which both the customer AND the Retention Agent suffer if and when an account is successfully closed.\\n\\n\\nThree weeks later, Comcast Executive Dave Watson [wrote in a memo to employees](http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/22/5926565/comcast-leaked-memo-reexamining-retention-call-policies) “I have tremendous admiration for our Retention professionals, who make it easy for customers to choose to stay with Comcast.”  In light of my Comcast experiences, I find Watson’s comments to be disturbing.  What Dave Watson unsettlingly characterizes as making it “easy for customers to choose to stay with Comcast” is in reality strong-arming consumers with heinous ~$1000 Termination Fees and then promptly delivering their bills to Collections, ravaging credit scores in the process.  Dave Watson – Comcast’s Chief Operating Officer - appears grossly unaware of how Comcast operates, or perhaps he is just openly proud of a coercive and reprehensible retention system.\\n\\n\\n**Being forced to agree to pay a $960 Termination Fee - for cancelling service that wasn’t working – was beyond demoralizing.  The next step in my separation from Comcast was equally disconcerting.**  As documented in my 8/13/14 [“Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees”] (http://redd.it/2dibwq) front page Reddit Post, I recorded myself returning all Comcast equipment, I got a signed & dated receipt from a Comcast Tech, I was later charged $360 in unreturned equipment fees, I then spent 115 minutes on the phone unsuccessfully fighting the equipment charges (with Erica on 7/16, Joy on 7/21, and Dawn on 7/22), and then even after all that I received bills in the mail for the $360 in unreturned equipment fees on 7/30 and 8/6.  My “Comcast’s Notorious Fees” post generated 5000 comments on Reddit, many of which told accounts that were remarkably similar to my own Comcast Equipment Fees experience.\\n\\n\\n**Also noteworthy, [The Full 13 Minute Recording of my Comcast Equipment Return](http://youtu.be/B-sjjaz-CoM) suggests that Comcast employees are aware of Comcast’s propensity to wrongly bill for “Unreturned” Equipment AND to send bills to Collections.**    \\n**Point #1:** [During 10:55 through 12:45 in the recording](http://youtu.be/B-sjjaz-CoM?t=10m55s\\t), Comcast Tech twice suggested the possibility that I might be falsely billed for the TV & Internet equipment, also advising me I should hold on to the TV & Internet equipment receipt. Interestingly, by stark contrast, Comcast Tech felt confident stating that I would not be falsely billed for Home Security equipment: “You don’t need to worry about these [the Home Security Equipment]... that’s all gonna get turned in and just get removed from your account.”  Comcast Tech’s statements proved to be dead accurate: I **WAS**  repeatedly billed $360 for “Unreturned” TV & Internet Equipment but I was **NOT** ever billed any fees for the Home Security Equipment (even though I returned all TV, Internet, and Home Security Equipment at the same time).    \\n**Point #2:** [At 6:50 into the recording]( http://youtu.be/B-sjjaz-CoM?t=6m50s), Comcast Tech very briefly made a reference to the unfortunate prospect of having a Comcast bill sent to Collections. I didn’t think much of his comment at the time, but I later read that for many years Comcast customers have been complaining furiously about terrible battles with collection agencies.  Comcast Tech’s passing reference to Collections is curious, especially in the context of compelling anecdotal and other evidence from customers (just google “Comcast collections bill” and/or read about Gary O’Reilly and Conal O’Rourke).\\n\\n\\n**During the past year, there have been [more than 160,000 comments about Comcast on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=comcast&sort=top&t=year).  The 160,000 comments TL;DR version: “We pretty much all f*cking hate Comcast”.**  The endless stream of extremely well documented nightmare experiences depicts practices that have gone on for years. Comcast’s behavior is so thoroughly systematic that Comcast customers like me began en masse to record and document all Comcast transactions in an absurdly arduous effort to not get screwed over.  Many in the media have suggested a “document everything and you should be OK” approach to consumer self-protection - but even that isn’t entirely accurate.  I had more documentation than any consumer could reasonably be expected to have – a signed receipt and 2+ hours of recordings – yet that was still not enough to avoid Comcast’s fee-generating system, nor was my documentation good enough to later get the equipment fees removed from my account.\\n\\n\\n**Comcast Fees and Collections are a vicious one-two punch.**    \\n-- I encourage The Verge to run another “Comcast Confessions” series to find out what Comcast accounting/billing employees can reveal about Unreturned equipment fees, Termination fees, and other miscellaneous fees.    \\n-- I hope someone or some organization might try to discern how much revenue Comcast generates from Unreturned Equipment fees, Termination fees, and other miscellaneous fees.    \\n-- I also hope someone will attempt to estimate the average and/or median income of Comcast customers, to show the context of how unconscionable it is for customers to be crushed by these fees.  (For example, someone who earns $30,000 annually would have to work roughly 100 hours at their job in order to pay off the $1320 in fees I faced after cancelling my Comcast account).    \\n-- And last, I applaud the ongoing effort by those who are currently investigating what I think might be **the most villainous phase of the Comcast system: wrongfully sending bills to collection agencies.**  Comcast has long devastated its customers’ credit histories by sending them to collections for bills that the customers don’t actually owe.  At this point, it would strain credibility for Comcast to claim that they are unaware of serious flaws in their accounting and billing practices. In light of mounting evidence that Comcast has neither the means to decipher which customer charges are erroneous, nor the ability to effectively resolve said erroneous charges, I call on Comcast to immediately suspend sending bills to collections until Comcast’s accounting and billing practices can be thoroughly investigated, audited, and then massively reformed.  The fact that Comcast continues to wrongfully send customers’ bills to collections agencies is extraordinarily callous and reeks of morally bankrupt leadership.\\n\\n\\nThe Comcast system isn’t merely negligent and unethical - it’s downright vicious.\\n\\n\\n-- This concludes Part 2 of CCTA –\\n\\n\\n**UPDATES**    \\n*[Comcast Trolls America Part 1: How Comcast Grinds You Down](http://redd.it/2mtxtf)*    \\n*[Comcast Trolls America Part 3: Reddit’s Magic Wand]( http://redd.it/2n1ghx)*    \\n*[Comcast Trolls America Part 4 - Non sequitur: Comcast Math](http://redd.it/2n6gvp)*    \\n*[Comcast Trolls America Part 5: The non-apology apology]( http://redd.it/2ngyh2)*. This has bricked my iPhone in so many ways and destroyed my battery life and I have a iPhones 6. realised today that the iPhone 6 has almost identical specs to the Samsung Galaxy S3 which was released in 2012.

Quick disclaimer - the specs above were copy/pasted directly from Wikipedia. If you disagree with them please feel free to update the respective wiki pages. I\\'m not going to change the stats here because, well I don\\'t care. I also want to clarify that I\\'m not saying the Galaxy S3 is better than the iPhone 6; it isn\\'t. I\\'m just pointing out the fact that the weight, screen size, CPU, RAM, battery and other specs of these two phones are indisputably similar. This is interesting, especially considering Apple recently sued Samsung for a billion dollars for copyright infringement! That being said, of course there is more to the story than just specs alone! But you can\\'t just say the specs are completely meaningless. If they were, why would any company bother talking about them? \\n\\nEdit: Updated formatting.

I have watched several comparison videos, and read quite a bit about the two phones. I am inclined to go with the Galaxy S3, but I thought I would post on here first. Who has one of these phones? Do you like them? Do you have any problems with them?\\nAlso, if I were to go for the S3, should I go for the Jelly Bean operating system?. [Original thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/13awxp/work_phone_iphone_5_or_android/)\\n\\nMy original thread pretty much had Android as the winner.  Still, I went out and bought an iPhone 5.\\n\\nBoy, was I wrong and were you right.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t the physical *iPhone* that was bad.  The actual hardware itself was great: beautiful phone, fantastic screen, extremely fast, great construction.  Physically it is an amazing phone.\\n\\nMy issue was with iOS.  I did not like the no shortcuts feature for wifi and bluetooth, the silent switch with ringer toggle was awful, I hated having to go into a bunch of different Settings menus.  I also missed the menu and back buttons at the botton of the phone.  I didn\\'t like how I couldn\\'t change the default settings such as the browser.  I also missed the smart dialer.  iMessage is cool though.\\n\\nSo I returned it and bought a Samsung Galaxy S3.  Ahhhhhhh, love all the new features and my old features!  Plus, I have a Samsung TV with All-Share so I can\\'t wait to get that going.. ##September 2017 Apple Event\\n\\nToday, Apple announced several new products. To avoid duplicating and spamming the front page of /r/Gadgets, please use this thread for discussion.\\n\\n##Summary\\n\\n###Apple TV\\n\\nThe Apple TV has been updated with 4K HDR support to dramatically increase the quality of your video and photo content. The new 4K model starts at $179 for 32gb and $199 for 64gb. Apple TV without 4K is $149.\\n\\n###Apple Watch Series 3\\n\\nThe Series 3 Apple Watch brings the option for embedded LTE to allow the watch to further act as a standalone device. Receive calls, messages, use Siri, and even play music all without your iPhone. New bands and cardiac features were also announced. The Series 3 comes in two models, LTE, which starts at $399, and the non-LTE model at $329.\\n\\n###iPhone 8 and 8 Plus\\n\\nThe iPhone 8 and 8 Plus feature a new glass design, wireless charging, Retina True Tone Display, updated camera features, and more. The iPhone 8 starts at $699 for 64gb, and the iPhone 8 Plus starts at $799 for 64gb.\\n\\n###iPhone X\\n\\nThe iPhone X has a 5.8 inch super-retina OLED display that fills the entire front of the phone. With a new design, wireless charging, FaceID, and advanced camera operations, the iPhone X starts at $999 for 64gb.\\n\\n. I\\'m opting to post this here instead of r/iphone and r/android to try and get a more general and less biased response.\\n\\nNot sure which one to go with:\\n\\nI find iPhone 4s pretty tempting but I\\'m not fully convinced the lack of control, open-ended customizability and flash support is a worthy trade-off. I\\'m also weary of planned obsolescence. Also, I\\'ve heared Apple doesn\\'t warranty its products?\\n\\nOn the other hand, iphone\\'s seamlessnes and intuitive qualities are pretty undeniable at this point. Also, with things like a larger pool of apps to choose from, HD video, 8megapixel camera, and freaking Siri (even though it\\'s still in beta) I don\\'t think I\\'ll have much left to desire in terms of customizable, homebrewed features.\\n\\nWhat\\'s your take?\\n\\n. I currently own a iPhone 4, as do most of my family, however my sister has been thinking about the DNA.  My mom and dad are being biased on the 5, but I as well don\\'t know much about the other phones.  Could you guys help me select a good phone?\\n\\nEdit: Verizon, sorry to forget including that. . UPDATE:  Got an iPhone 5S, which I was able to get for $40 used with my plan upgrade.  I\\'m very happy with it.  Thanks for all of the advice!\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis will be my first smartphone.  I\\'ve been resisting getting one for a while because I didn\\'t want the distraction of constant internet access, but it\\'s gotten to the point where having one is an expectation.  So I\\'m only looking at the ones I can get free with two-year activation (as a result, they\\'re not the latest/best phones).\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThese are my preferences, if possible:\\n\\n* High quality camera\\n* Intuitive interface\\n* Can download most apps\\n* Good battery life\\n* Good reputation for not breaking\\n* Can fit in girl pockets (not really holding out hope that this is possible, though)\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n**Edit:  I\\'ve narrowed it down to the iPhone 5c, the Moto X, and the Samsung S4 Mini.  How do these fare with regards to the six things I mentioned?**\\n\\n\\nThese are the options:\\n\\n* iPhone 5c\\n* iPhone 4s\\n* HTC One remix\\n* LG G Vista\\n* LG G2\\n* LG Lucid 3\\n* LG Enact\\n* Motorola Droid Mini\\n* Moto X\\n* Motorola Droid Razr\\n* Nokia Lumia 928\\n* Blackberry Z10\\n\\n\\nI\\'m also considering the Samsung S4 Mini, even though it\\'s not free (it\\'s $50), because I\\'ve heard good things about the Samsung S series.. Hey, gadgeteers! Here is this week\\'s thread where we can all post up discussions, comparisons and advice on various gadgets.\\nFor specific questions we highly recommend you also look [at the list of related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/related_subreddits) since you are more likely to find an answer in a specialized subreddit. \\n\\n[Sort by new](/r/gadgets/about/sticky/?sort=new) to see unanswered questions.\\n. At this point I\\'ve read hundreds of reviews across multiple sites, but even still I value Reddit\\'s just a bit more. I\\'m looking for over-the-ear type headphones with superior sound quality for under 100 bucks. In order, these are the most important things to me:\\n\\n1) Sound quality- Sound needs to blow me away. I want to hear every instrument with absolute clarity. I don\\'t plan on buying an expensive amp either, so they should sound just as good on my laptop and mp3.\\n\\n2) Comfort- I plan on listening for long time periods while studying or chilling in my room (probably 3-4 hours at at time). I don\\'t want my ears bruised after an hour. Basically I want to feel like nothings there if possible, although I hear this comes at a much higher price point.\\n\\n3) Looks- I know this sounds a bit shallow to real audiophiles, but I don\\'t want to look dorky wearing these in public. This isn\\'t as important as the other two, but when I do decide to walk around campus in these I don\\'t to be Queen Amidala.\\n\\nThere are three right now that have caught my intrest, but I\\'m open to any suggestions at this point (however if you could comment on my selections it would be much appreciated): Sony MDR7506, Sennheiser HD-280 Pro, Sennheiser HD-238i (these have a mic and iPhone controls. They also look a heck of lot nicer than the other two imo).\\n\\nRight now I own a pair of Klipsh Image S4 earbuds, so if you could make a comparison to these I would understand better. Personally I love mine, especially for the comfort factor. The only knock I have is that they seem especially bass heavy, which is great when listening to hiphop and some rock, however I\\'d like my acoustic songs to pop a bit more.\\n\\nAlso I know these threads have been posted several times already across multiple subs, and believe me I\\'ve read them all, but I wanted some fresh opinions before I make my decision.\\n\\n\\nEdit- UPDATE: I decided to go with the Audio Technica ATH-M50. I found a pair for $120, and from what I\\'ve read its well worth going $20 higher than my previous price range. I can give an amateur review when they get here if anyone is interested. \\n\\nThanks for all the help. . I recently got a job where I will be a traveling salesperson on the road.  The company offers a Blackberry (ugh), or I can get my own phone and they\\'ll reimburse me for some of it.  I\\'ve used BB before, and I won\\'t go back.\\n\\nI currently have an Android phone, a Verizon Droid Incredible (first one).  I liked it, but it is glitchy and sometimes it would give me a headache with it\\'s bugginess.\\n\\nI\\'ve been leaning iPhone 5, but I also want to give Android a fair shake.  I\\'d probably look at a Nexus phone over the SGIII because I don\\'t want to walk around with hand-TV in my pocket all day.\\n\\nI\\'m just curious overall about which phone would be a better \"work\" phone (IT dept would support both types).  I\\'d like to be able to tether if possible to my work laptop, but I know that costs a BUTTLOAD if you do it through the carrier (which would be VZW).  Which phone is stronger for people using their phone for their job, vs. media playing abilities?. Let\\'s take the top three flagship phones from the top 3 companies. iPhone 7 Plus, Pixel XL, and Galaxy S7 Edge (or the Note 7 if you count it). All three have 16 bit DACs. Seems normal? Fine.\\n\\nNow, look at my 2012 HP Pavilion (i don\\'t even remember the model now, but it is lower mid range. i3 Second Gen, 4GB RAM, 768p TN, the usual). It has a 24 bit DAC. And nowadays, about every laptop released has a 24 bit DAC. Yet the phones (bar the LG V20, that shit sounds godly with uncompressed FLAC and good headsets) nowadays have stuck to 16 bit, since 2008. Why is this? Is there any particular reasons I can\\'t listen to better quality sound on my $500 phone from 2015 (I own a Nexus 6P), but rather on my $350 laptop from 2012? Why?\\n\\nTo those saying it doesn\\'t make a difference, go and pick up some half decent earplugs or a headset. Plug it into your phone, play a file (320kbps is my go to if you want max quality but want to save storage, but you can always go FLAC if you have the storage). Now plug it into your laptop. Play the same music, same file. Now back to the phone. There\\'s a huge difference. I don\\'t want you to eliminate the goddamn headphone jacks (looking at you, Motorola and Apple), but rather elevate an experience to new heights. LG took a step with the V20, and to a 32bit DAC at that, but it hasn\\'t spurred any competition. Only Axon and HTC do 24 bit DAC as well, especially on their flagships, but they aren\\'t even mainstream any more in HTC\\'s case. I want the best experience, and to an audio lover like me, sound helps make it. \\n\\n\\nI really, really, really hope that by the time I get my next phone in 3 years, it must have better sound quality. This is fucking 2017 guys, why are we still using standards used a decade ago when there are clearly better options?\\n. The last phone i had was an HTC One V, i got it because it was cheap and small. Its shit slow now (takes me about 5 minutes to save a contact) so i want a new phone. Price doesnt matter much now since i have to get it on contract anyway. My preference would be something not too big but still able to match up to modern phones. \\n\\nEdit- I live in Canada, if that helps. So I have in front of me the opportunity to swap an iPhone 5 16GB for a Nexus 5, 32GB. \\n\\nBesides the obvious storage advantage by the Nexus, what would you do? Would you keep the iPhone or would you swap it for the Nexus?\\n\\nThank you\\n\\nEDIT: So I swapped the iPhone for the Nexus, and so far it\\'s been great. I\\'m still getting used to Android but it feels nice. I notice it\\'s a little crazy on the auto-brightness, but despite that, I really like it. I can say that this one doesn\\'t feel as luxurious as the iPhone, but it does feel more comfortable, and I\\'m liking that approach.\\nI\\'ll update the post in a few days to check with you guys. Thanks for all the advice.. *Let me start out with this... I live in this awesome world where I enjoy intel as well as AMD.  Windows as well as MAC and Linux.  iOS just as much as Android.  Get it?  I embrace and love all technology so please be open minded and leave the egocentric opinions out.  True geeks only please.*\\n\\nSo here\\'s where I\\'m at with choosing between the iPhone 4s and the Nexus Prime.  This is based on some assumptions but they seem to be pretty accurate.  I\\'m open to all sides.  FYI, I currently own an iPhone 3gs.  I also have a nook color rooted and custom ROM\\'d.\\n\\n**iPhone 4s Pros**\\n\\n* Apps and accessories already purchased\\n* iOS is already very familiar\\n* Hardware / feel is very nice\\n* Great battery life\\n* Better pixel density on the screen\\n* Siri/voice integration looks flippin awesome.  If it works like they say that is.\\n* Better apps, better quality of apps and generally first in line for big apps and games.\\n\\n\\n**iPhone 4s Cons**\\n\\n* Smaller screen than the prime\\n* More difficult to customize and tweak\\n* Some things are not possible to tweak, overclocking, swapable keyboards, launchers, etc.\\n* Getting bored with iOS\\n* Will probably stick with AT&T, not as good as Verizon\\n* No LTE\\n\\n\\n\\n**Nexus Prime Pros**\\n\\n* Get to start out with Ice Cream Sandwich\\n* Larger screen\\n* On a better network, Verizon (rumor)\\n* Will have super fast LTE (rumor)\\n* Android is more tweakable and hackable\\n* Get to learn new stuff\\n* Will be \"new\" to me and shiny.  \\n* Will be a Nexus device so much better support and updates\\n\\n\\n**Nexus Prime Cons**\\n\\n* Good pixel density considering the size however still less than the iPhone\\n* Will have to repurchase all apps and accessories \\n* I\\'m very worried about battery life\\n* Android doesn\\'t have the \"just works\" polish that iOS does.  Expect more bugs.\\n* App quality is not as good as iOS, not as many apps, and iOS usually gets big name apps and games much quicker\\n* Not sure I like the curved screen?\\n* Unsure of the optics in the camera.  Apple usually hits it out of the park in the camera area.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s what I got.  Anyone else on the fence with me?  Anything to add?  This is a living list so I\\'ll add to it as input is given.  . Hey guys\\n\\nI am in real trouble with picking out a tablet PC for my girlfriend for christmas.\\n\\nI keep hearing that I should go for an iPad of sorts, yet I have always been reluctant to buy any Apple products due to their lack of flexibility (we own neither macs nor iPhones and are therefore completely ignorant of Apple products and completely used to Windows and Android systems)\\n\\nShe is mostly going to use it for general internet browsing, Facebook, the occasional movie and random games.\\n\\nCan you guys make any suggestions and provide reasoning? Looking to spend a maximum of around 700$.\\n\\nTL;DR: Help me pick a tablet PC for my girlfriend\\'s christmas present. General, everyday use\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for your replies guys, I read them all with interest! I have a follow-up question. What\\'s the deal with 16 og 32 GB? What do you use the space for and is it necessary with 32 gb?. Posting this here because /r/android seems to lack convo :(\\n\\nI am due for an upgrade 11/16 with AT&T. Currently an iPhone 4 user. No real complains other than my phone itself is a dumb smartphone (wifi and GPS are broken due to dropping mainboard while screen replacing). I have a nexus 7 tab that I fell in love with. Jelly bean is a fantastic operating system and IOS6 really isn\\'t all \"amazing\" in my mind. I like the Samsung s3 for the rave reviews however the nexus 4 looks promising as well. Main uses for phone are txting, music, GPS and a good camera. Avid fisherman and I only have a small window to grab a shot before I let a fish swim away.\\n\\nShould I rush out and buy an GS3? Wait for nexus 4? Wait for gs4 and suffer the winter without WIFI or GPS?\\n\\nTL:DR Fruit is rotten, need pr0n\\n. I have had it with the poor quality and bad service from Garmin.  I have owned four Garmin units, and bought or recommended many more.  But each one has failed, though all in slightly different ways.  They are badly built and poorly supported.  \\n\\nMost recently, the Bluetooth on my Nuvi 885 just stopped working.  After spending a week e-mailing their \\'support\\' staff, and resetting every imaginable setting and reloading the software countless times, I\\'m done.  Garmin says they\\'ll fix it for $150 (!)  but I\\'ve already spend $2,000 with these clowns. I\\'ll be dammed if they get another penny from me or anyone I can keep from buying their crappy products.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve a good experience with Magellon, Tom Tom, or another brand, please let me know which unit you own; what you like about it; and anything you don\\'t like about it.\\n\\nP.S.  I have an iPhone but I really want a stand-alone GPS solution.\\n\\nEdit - corrected the model number from 855 to 885. First off, I want to make it clear I have never been a dedicated Apple fan. I did use their products, but there was a lot about Apple I never liked, and I stuck with them for as long as I did strictly because I had so much money tied up in the Apple ecosystem.\\n\\n\\nI purchased my first iPod Video back in 2008, and over the years have owned an iPhone 3G, an iPhone 4S and an iPad Mini. As I mentioned with the ecosystem, before ditching my iPhone 4S a couple weeks ago, I had spent thousands of dollars on movies, TV shows and apps via the iTunes store. None of which I can use except on Apple devices. (I\\'m not comfortable with trying to crack the DRM to use them elsewhere)\\n\\n\\nBut I became increasingly frustrated with how limited Apple products were, as well as very annoyed with constant bugs that plague their software. Add to all that the horrible business decisions Apple kept making, like adding that stupid U2 album to everyone\\'s library, then making them jump through hoops to get rid of it.\\n\\n\\nOn to specifics. I will cover what I both liked and disliked about my 4S, and Apple in general, and what I like and dislike about my new Nexus 6 and Android.\\n\\n\\nThe 4S. Going from the 3G to the 4S felt amazing at first, but now that I\\'ve had more than two years to reflect on the switch, I can say there was not a major difference between the two phones. I did really enjoy the fact that it was simple as plugging in my new phone to have absolutely everything transferred over for me automatically, and the ease of use in adjusting various settings on the phone. But that convenience was quickly outweighed by several issues.\\n\\n\\nAfter about 6 months of using my 4S, iTunes stopped recognizing that my computer and device were paired together. This happened after I was without access to my computer for a couple weeks and simply had been downloading old purchases like TV shows to watch straight from iTunes. (A feature they didn\\'t even always have)\\n\\n\\nI could sync my iPhone to my computer, but it wouldn\\'t automatically transfer any purchases made on my phone to my iTunes backup. So if I bought and downloaded an app on my phone, then had to apply a software update via iTunes, I would lose that app and would have to redownload it and reinstall it on my phone.\\n\\n\\niTunes support was incapable of even understanding the issue I was having, and I eventually figured out how to manually transfer purchases via iTunes on my own. But the underlying issue was never fixed, and iTunes support refused to help me further once I discovered a workaround. A full reinstall of iTunes didn\\'t even fix the problem.\\n\\n\\nAfter a little more than a year of use, the lock button on my phone broke. After doing 5 seconds of research, I discovered this was a very common issue for all iPhones. But even though Apple recognized it as a defect, they would only fix the problem for people outside of their warranty if they had an iPhone 5 or newer. I full understand why warranties are limited, but known defects should, and often are, handled by better companies outside the warranty period.\\n\\n\\nAs time went on I became increasingly frustrated with the tiny size of the phone. Everyone I knew had phones with 4.5 inches or larger, and was constantly jealous of all that extra space. I very much enjoy gaming on my cellphone, but the tiny 3.5 inch screen made gaming a pain. And speaking of gaming, the horribly weak internal specs made simple games like Plants vs Zombies 2 practically unplayable. Its RAM and processing power simply could not handle the game.\\n\\n\\nWith all my frustration adding up, I just couldn\\'t stand putting up with Apple any longer. Even when their iPhone 6 and 6+ came out, I didn\\'t even give them a second though. The base model still comes with a pathetic 16GB of storage, and an insulting 1GB of RAM.\\n\\n\\nOn top of that, only the 6+ has a 1920x1080 resolution, and in my own personal opinion, 1920x1080 should be the minimum stand for any phone with a screen 4.5 inches are larger. The price difference between a 720 and 1080 screen for Apple would have been pennies. \\n\\n\\nThere is just no excuse for the iPhone 6 to still be using pointless resolutions like 1334x750, as there is no content in existence made for that resolution. Everything has to be scaled, either up or down, to fit on the screen.\\n\\n\\nWith all of that said and done, I started thinking about the switch to Android about a year ago. I was very interested in the Nexus series based on everything I had read about the Nexus 5. I have experience dealing with Samsung from helping out friends and family with their various Galaxy S2, S3, S4 and S5 devices over the years, and knew I wanted NOTHING to do with Samsung.\\n\\n\\nI also got some experience with a HTC One M8 that I set up for my father, I recommended it based on reviews I read, but was appalled by the amount of bloatware on the phone. Both from his carrier and HTC. I deleted about a dozen worthless apps, and there were over two dozen more that I couldn\\'t delete without rooting the device.\\n\\n\\nSo everything I kept finding out about other Android phones kept making the Nexus series look better and better. I followed every rumor about the Nexus 6, and had to exercise a lot of restraint in not giving up and just getting a different phone after my iPhone was up for renewal in April.\\n\\n\\nThe Nexus 6 was finally released and it was everything I wanted. A big screen, great resolution, great internals, a reasonable amount of storage, no stupid physical home button. I\\'ve now had that Nexus 6 for about 2 weeks, and this is my opinion on the phone and Android.\\n\\n\\nAs you can probably tell, I very much like the physical aspects of the phone. Yes its huge, but I was prepared for that and have absolutely no issues with it. Its a phone that requires two hands, its that easy.\\n\\n\\nI took the time to integrate things like my iPhones contacts into my Google account before I got the phone, so getting everything transferred over that I could was very simple. It also took me all of 30 minutes to work my way through all the different settings that I wanted for the phone.\\n\\n\\nWidgets and live wallpapers are amazing. Using a file manager and AirDroid to sync up to my computer, it was extremely easy to set up any mp3 I wanted as a ringtone. While I already knew that most apps want access to tons of information, it was very nice to see a prompt with a complete list of permissions before installing an app. Something Apple doesn\\'t offer.\\n\\n\\nI picked up my old iPhone 4S after about 30 minutes of playing with my new Nexus 6, and I really did LoL. The screen for the Nexus 6 swallows the entire size of the iPhone 4S, with a case on it, and has room to spare. My screen size is so big that I was able to ditch my old Kindle. I love my Kindle, but my new phone as a screen that is the exact same size, and better quality with a backlight, so its nice to not have to use two devices.\\n\\n\\nNow, there are some things about the phone I do not like. Mainly things I could do on my iPhone 4S, but can\\'t do on my Nexus 6. First is with the Nexus 6, ALL notifications are the same, and use the same notification sound. Through a file manager I can set those sounds to a mp3, but everything is still the same. Meaning a notification from an app has to use the same sound that I want to use for text messages.\\n\\n\\nI am also unable to set a specific sound/mp3 to text messages from different people. With my 4S I could set a contact to play one mp3 for when they called me, and a different mp3 if they sent me a text message. And both can be completely different for each contact. I found that very useful because like many people, a direct phone call is usually more important to respond to than a text message.\\n\\n\\nI also don\\'t want something really loud and obvious like an MP3 for an app notification. So I am either stuck with weak, generic, sounds for text messages, or really a loud and obvious mp3 for app notifications. This limitation seems to be strictly a limitation of the phone as other Android phones support what my phone doesn\\'t.\\n\\n\\nThe wifi connection has also been an issue for me, and many other people who are using Android 5.0. I knew its just a bug that should eventually get fixed, but I find it very annoying to have to constantly change the broadcast channel on my router, just so my phone will connect to it. Its not an issue with my router or my ISP because I have 12 devices, various phones, tablets and a printer, all connected to the wifi, and none of them have issues.\\n\\nMy only other complaint is the volume and lock buttons. They are placed too close to the center of the phone, and their shape/texture is too much alike that its difficult to know which one you are pushing based just on feel.\\n\\nSo, after all of that, I am very, very happy with my Nexus 6, and have no desire to switch back to Apple.. I\\'ve been an iPhone user since the first one was released. I\\'ve also been a Google Voice user since it was first Beta. I recently updated to the iPhone 5 and have been growing increasinly tired of having to use the Google Voice app for texting. On a Jailbroken iPhone, I can install GV SMS Extension and GV Phone Extension and everything is awesome. Jailbreaks are taking increasingly long to come out and I\\'m starting to wish I was an Android man, so Google Voice would just work nice. I also like to occasionally tether my phone with a Jailbreak app, and do face time and stuff over cellular data. I\\'m grandfathered into my Unlimited Plan on AT&T, and I have a very large app collection, some expensive ones. Next time my contract is up, I\\'ll be thinking about alternatives, but its hard to switch from my grandfathered unlimited plan, large collection of apps, and familiar OS. I would be happy enough with the stock iOS if there was Google Voice support built in. Is it worth it to change? Is there any chance for Native Google Voice ever in iOS, without jailbreaking? My phone feels so crippled without a Jailbreak. Like it\\'s in Jail. I wish I had stuck with my older phone until a Jailbreak came out. I have a 4S on 6.0 for my girlfiend sitting in my desk drawer because she also uses google voice and doesn\\'t want to use an iPhone without a jailbreak.. I like to listen to music while I am biking or running (flames ahoy!), but I don\\'t want to spend an incredible amount of money on \"ear-loop\" headphones when I have nice sounding earbuds that come with my phone or MP3 player. Is there any product out that just clips on to the headphone wire or base of the earbud that converts it into a wrap around?\\n\\nExample: [earbud](http://www.amazon.com/headphone-microphone-Touch-iphone-Generic/dp/B0021IPXUG/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1350485851&sr=8-16&keywords=earbuds) > [earbud with attached loop](http://www.amazon.com/headphone-microphone-Touch-iphone-Generic/dp/B0021IPXUG/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1350485851&sr=8-16&keywords=earbuds)\\n\\nNow this shows a lifehack version, but is there any actual product that does this with a good feel/fit?. Okay here the \"rules\":\\nIt has to be on AT&T (Corporate account - I have no choice)\\nI can get a 3G Blackberry for free, or i can pay my own $$ to get a different one if I want.\\nI don\\'t really follow this gadget market much so could use some advice.... the options that seem interesting to me are:\\n\\nHTC Aria\\n\\nSamsung Captivate\\n\\nBlackberry Torch\\n\\nIphone 4\\n\\nI don\\'t know which to get, the bb and iphone are pretty obvious to me but i\\'m really intersted in android , although I hear AT&T locks them down pretty bad (is that beatable?)\\n\\nMy last option is to wait a bit (I dont need to do this right away) if anything really cool is coming out soon.\\n\\nOne thing I like about blackberry is the real keyboard and I dont think any of these other ones have one...\\n\\nAny other advice anyone could give that has actually used one (especially the androids or something coming up soon)\\nthanks reddit!\\n\\n(Note: Crossposted to askreddit). Okay so seeing as the iPhone has killed the headphone jack yet many of us still want to use our own headphones. I\\'ve used two Bluetooth devices to use my wired headphones with my phone but while they\\'re good they\\'re still lacking. \\n\\nMy dream device would allow me to use my in line mic rather than the device itself, multiple connections would be awesome too (multipoint?) so I could have it connected to my laptop and phone simultaneously so I could hear notifications from my phone while watching youtube etc. If anyone knows of a device that ticks these boxes let me know. \\n\\nThe first device I used for this was an Aukey bluetooth adapter https://www.amazon.co.uk/Portable-Bluetooth-Receiver-Streaming-BR-C2/dp/B00P78FCQW it was good but not very feature rich and the mic was in the device so I couldn\\'t use my in line mic. This one doesn\\'t appear on the website but an updated version which can connect to two devices is available http://www.aukey.com/product/BR-C9\\n\\nThe second device I have used is the creative e3 http://uk.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/sound-blaster-e3 with nfc for easy connection and a good battery life you can use this over otg with android devices use as an usb amp for your laptop and has two outputs so you can share your music. Disadvantages of this is its bulky you need to reconnect to each device and the mic is in the device rather than taking advantage of my in line. \\n\\nThe Verge just had an article about a griffin device http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/30/12717100/griffin-bluetooth-headphone-adapter-itrip-clip but again uses a builtin mic. \\n\\n\\nSo are there any other noteworthy devices in this category? What are people planning to use? \\n\\n. I purchased windows phone 7 about a month after it came out, and I am going to confidently say this phone is going to be far better than any Android. First off, when I use my friends Androids(all of my friends have android), I only notice how laggy and unresponsive it is. My friends also complain on how it only gets slower after every update.. but then again, android is open source, supports flash and has SO many apps.. \\n\\nNow, the real reason I\\'m making this post is because of the Mango update coming out this Fall. I\\'ve realized that FOR ONCE, Microsoft has made a truly unique, fast, beautiful and over all GOOD PHONE. I would love to talk about the new updates and why I like them, but this [guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP30F3ZxTmw) does it way better.\\n\\nAlso, something he doesn\\'t talk about in the video. \\n\\n- 25gbs of free cloud storage(windowslive account)\\n\\n- pinning anything(really, anything you want) to your homescreen, and those tiles update automatically, as long as their on your home screen.\\n\\n- linking social networks to your contacts, pictures and emails. This is actually really cool. for example, All of my facebook photos, cloud photos, and email photos are ALL found in my Pictures application, as long as I link it. If you link contacts with your friends on facebook, it automatically adds their email and phone number(if available) to your phone. \\n\\n- APPS, a lot of people think WP7 doesn\\'t have a very wide selection of apps. The first 3 months, yep, NO good apps, but in the passed two months ive got all the ones i need such as, Angry birds, Plants vs Zombies, Bank of America, Netflix, Manga Reader, Code Scanner, reddit, twitter, weatherbug, translator, Tetris, Oregon Trail, and my fricken Xboxlive account.. And according to the update I\\'ll be able to chat with my friends who are in game on xbox.. I think that is AWESOME\\n\\n- Now I\\'m not a businessy kind of man, but if I want, I can write a document on word, put it on live(takes 2 seconds) and continue writing it on my phone.\\n\\n- Web Browser, I Think we can all agree Internet explorer is the number one browser to download another browser, but internet explorer is completely different on WP7. I previously owned the iphone 3gs, and I can say confidently its much faster, loads the actual website before it loads the ads. very nice touch.\\n\\n- And my FAVORITE thing by far is, click on ANY contact(as long as you\\'ve linked their profiles) email them, map their home address, text, call, see their significant other, see their birthday, see whats new on facebook or twitter with them and thats without GOING to any of those websites.. seriously, just one click away for all that information.. as long as its on your homescreen that is..\\n\\nI\\'m very happy that Microsoft has for once actually listened to their consumers, GOOD JOB MICROSOFT, proud supporter.\\n\\n\\n. My price cap is about $150 at the moment. I know the be-st cameras are easily $200+, but the main use will be to record commutes in case an accident or other event happens. Here are a few I have been looking at so far:\\n\\n - **[Monoprice HD Camera](http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=108&cp_id=10834&cs_id=1083408&p_id=10159&seq=1&format=2#description)**: This seems like my best bet and I am ok with waiting a month to buy it. The only bad thing Ihave heard about it is that there is no higher FPS than 30 on this camera. I did see in [youtube comments](http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=108&cp_id=10834&cs_id=1083408&p_id=10159&seq=1&format=2#description) by a monoprice rep that \"60 fps is coming soon...\" but I have not heard if this will be a separate camera or a firmware update. Besides that, does this seem like a good deal? The 3 hour battery isn\\'t too great, but my 15 minute commutes and availability to power sources makes it not too much of a problem. It also gives me a reason for another portable USB charger :)  **[video example 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S37eX90CEQg)** **[video example 2](http://vimeo.com/57111944)**\\n\\n - **[Polaroid Action Cams](http://www.polaroidstore.com/store/categories/sport-and-action-video-cameras.htm)**: A few different versions available with different features and options.

Any more info or experience with items I\\'ve posted here?\\n\\nThanks to all who can help!. Hey /r/gadgets,\\n\\nSo, I have finally have a high enough paying job and important enough reasons to find worth in having a phone. I had the Nokia 3310 for most of high school, which was great cause it did exactly what I wanted: text and call. I upgraded at a very slow rate compared to the rate new phones were being made, and the last phone I had was before the big smart phone boom (i.e. when the general population was just starting to realize how amazing smart phones were). The last phone I had was a touch screen, but not a smart phone (very disappointing as it was sold to me advertised as a smart phone), and it was a big disappointment. Then, I got screwed over by T-Mobile when they began to take money from my bank account without permission. After a bit of legal struggles, and the realization that I don\\'t actually enjoy having a device that lets people I don\\'t like call/text me 24/7 with the knowledge that at some point I would have my phone and have to answer them, I decided to say screw it and not get another phone.\\n\\nSo, thanks to the awesomeness that is GMail and it\\'s free calling with text/chat, I haven\\'t needed a cell phone for three years+. But, the time has come for me to assimilate with the rest of the world! I\\'m making good money, I\\'ve learned from past mistakes/friend\\'s mistakes with phone companies, and I\\'ve used my girlfriends Galaxy S II enough to know I\\'d like a smart phone.\\n\\nOver the past year, I\\'ve been shopping around and doing my research. I\\'ve compared phones, tablets (and just using Skype/VoIP), and things in between, but I\\'m still not sure on what\\'s the best fit for me. Some of my experiences contrast others, so here I am now, asking you guys for your input. I\\'m guessing it all comes down to Android vs. IPhone vs. Windows Phone. Most of my experience is with the Galaxy S II, but while I love it, I\\'m not *in* love with it... Having updated to ICS just two months ago and now hearing that there\\'s something called Jelly Bean already is not very comforting feeling. I\\'ve been a Windows user since Windows 95, so the idea of getting a Window\\'s phone is really intriguing to me, but I don\\'t have the experience/testing with them like I have with Android/IPhone. As for IPhone... I\\'m probably going to avoid them. Expensive, not as much user customization, and the new IPhone 5 is just a shiny IPhone 4 (all of this is my opinion). But if it\\'s not like I can\\'t be swayed into getting one if it\\'s the best route.\\n\\nNo matter what I was getting, I decided that, if I\\'ve waited this long already, I can wait until the holiday sales begin and get my new phone as cheap as possible. So back and forth I\\'ve been going with all of these phones, and carriers, and functions, and add-on\\'s, and coverage, and this and that and this...\\n\\nBut, then I saw this: [Galaxy S III For $49.99](http://d3c22c780257309bb66f-10813ceff433c2120525ab927a1198f8.r4.cf2.rackcdn.com/sprint-bf.jpeg)\\n\\nWell shit. I feel like Sprint is a good carrier from friendly advice and the fact that they\\'re my girlfriend\\'s carrier. Plus, I have Android experience and enjoy them, along with the fact that I am highly interested in rooting/jailbreaking my phone... So is this the deal breaker I\\'ve been looking for? Is anyone here a Windows phone users who could trump this kind of a deal with knowledge that I\\'d be missing out on a better experience with a Windows phone? Is an IPhone going to even get close to this kind of deal? Sorry for the wall of text, guys, but thanks for any help/advice that is given!\\n\\nTL;DR: No phone for 3 years, finally buying one. Deciding between Windows vs Android. Found Galaxy SIII Black Friday ad for 50 bucks. Is this the way to go?\\n\\nEDIT: Fixed Droid =/= Android. #Weekend Reader: Third Week Of December\\n\\n*We\\'re back again for our third weekend reader, highlighting the top posts and comments in /r/gadgets.*\\n\\nSure, you could always press the [sort by top](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/top/?sort=top&t=week) button, so we\\'ll also be pulling some top comments and posts within our superthreads.

You could win free Reddit Gold!. I am finally looking into getting a smart phone and I am leaning toward the HTC One. The one thing that bothers me is group messaging, I hear it dosen\\'t work with iPhones, and apps to do this have problems.\\n\\nI heard from one friend that android 4.2.x has support for group text now but I don\\'t know wither or not to believe him. If so how long would it take for the HTC to update? Would I be better off going with the GS4?\\n\\niPhone is out of the question for me, I am tired of iOS on my iPod I want a change. I believe that I would enjoy the HTC One more than the GS4, but group text is really important to me. Before I buy anything I just wanted your thoughts and input. Thanks.. r/Ipads doesn\\'t want this kind of question hopefully you geeks can help me better here :)  Just found out my Mom bought an Ipad through ATT  and then got it stolen less than a week later.  She is under contract to pay their data plan for another 16 months or something even though she has no ipad.  \\n\\nI\\'d like to give her one but am a bit short on money and was wondering if there is a smarter way to buy than direct through Apple or ATT.  Newegg etc?  I know theres lots of other tablets but I know she has difficulty with tech and already knows her iphone so it\\'d be easier to adjust.  She also has not-so-great eyesight so the larger version would be preferable.\\n\\nI really appreciate any suggestions.  Thanks.. I work with a small NGO that provides water and agricultural projects in rural areas. We are looking for creative ways to raise funds. One idea was to have donors \"sponsor\" one of our staff members that do work on these projects. To give our donors regular updates about staff activities, we were thinking of getting donated smart phones so that the staff person could take geo-tagged pictures/videos in the field, write updates on Facebook (or some alternative) about what they have been doing and follow them on Latitude. Our staff don\\'t live in the field, they do get back to a big city regularly.\\n\\nWe were thinking about asking for used smart phones as donations. I\\'m looking into Android and iPhones and had some questions.\\n\\n* Battery Life--I have an Android phone and it is difficult to keep a charge for more than 15 hours. It would be more difficult with GPS constantly on and poor cell phone reception. We could recommend ways to avoid that problem (airplane mode and not playing games in the field, for example). Would an iPhone be significantly better?\\n* Unlocking--I have rooted my android phone and if we go the Android route, I would try to get phones with unlockable bootloaders (or find other ways to use them on other networks). How difficult is it to unlock ATT iPhones to use on other networks? We do need GSM phones.\\n* iTunes and other obligations--Do iPhones still require iTunes for any reason at all? Are there other obligations to using the iPhone? I heard you had to have a credit card associated with the account?\\n* Context Settings--Is there anything similar to Tasker on iPhone? For example, for privacy reasons, we want to automatically turn off location reporting during off hours. We could also use this to conserve battery life.\\n\\nWe are on Google Apps for our email service and get Picasa with that. We could probably also set up Google+ accounts, but most people are on Facebook. I\\'m still looking into how we will provide regular updates.\\n\\nFinally, I realize I am only considering iPhones and Android phones. Should I consider Blackberries, Nokias or Windows phones? Remember, these will be donations.\\n\\nThanks in advance for any help you can provide!. I\\'ve had it with this.  I have an original 8GB 2G.  It\\'s hardware-capable of stereo Bluetooth streaming and sending/receiving rich MMS (you can even enable it if you\\'re jailbroken) but they\\'re intentionally crippled by the software.  I was also one of the people who had the privilege of paying an extra $200 at launch, before the price was dropped.\\n\\nNow, I find out that my still-perfectly-functioning phone won\\'t be able to take advantage of any of the new features available in the new iPhone OS.  If I had a 3G, I\\'d be even more angry--locked into a two year contract with an almost-new phone that can\\'t even be updated.  How long before iPhone 4-only apps rule the store and we can\\'t get anything new at all?\\n\\nMy next phone is coming from Android.. Consider this:\\n\\nThe last time any iPod got a hardware update was September 2010. The iPod Classic hasn’t been updated since 2009. Besides software updates, nothing else has changed in the iPod world except a price drop and release of a white 4th-gen iPod touch when Apple announced the iPhone 4S in October 2011.\\n\\nWhen that happened, I just assumed that Apple would be swapping their iPod and iPhone release times, releasing new phones in the fall and releasing new iPods at WWDC from now on. But now WWDC 2012 has come upon us, and we\\'ve seen neither head nor tail of any new mobile device beginning with an i. In fact, Apple is actually *removing* support for all iPod touches except the 4th-gen from iOS 6. Despite this, they still continue to support the iPhone 3GS, which was released in the same year as and contains very similar hardware to the 3rd-gen iPod touch. Seems suspicious to me.\\n\\nSo what does this all mean? Why is Apple\\'s flagship product of over a decade, the product that helped them regain their popular status in the technology world, being ignored by its maker? It\\'s starting to seem to me that they might be preparing to abandon it. Think about it: the iPhone does everything that any iPod can do, plus it has a phone, a 3G radio, and more RAM and a better camera than the touch. The iPad even has LTE. With the iPhone coming to more and more carriers (here in the States anyway, I don\\'t know about other countries), maybe they\\'ve decided that the legendary iPod has run its course. They\\'re historically not a company afraid of making big changes like this.\\n\\nOr maybe they just decided that WWDC wouldn\\'t be the appropriate place to unveil new iPods. After all, it is a *developers\\'* conference, and only one model of iPod is capable of installing third-party apps. Maybe they\\'ll just be refreshing the iPod and iPhone together in the fall from now on. Or maybe they have something better in store for us.\\n\\nBut even reflecting on these last points, I can\\'t help but think, *”Why have they waited so long?”*\\n\\n**EDIT:** [Also posted to /r/Apple](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ux8pm/why_is_apple_ignoring_the_ipod/)..

I currently have a Motorola Atrix 4g phone and I like it but the longer I have it the buggier it becomes.  I\\'m looking for advice on my next phone.  I\\'m due for an upgrade in Feb but I think I can get one even earlier.\\n\\nHere\\'s what I\\'m looking for:\\nI like Android but not locked in to the platform.  I\\'m getting a little disenfranchised with the update and fragmentation issues.  \\nI own one of the phones that Moto screwed over with with their update plans and while I think the $100 rebate would be nice it looks like the only phone on AT&T I can use it for is the Atrix HD and I\\'m not sure if I want to go down the Moto road again.\\nI haven\\'t had a Iphone since the 3GS and I would be open to the 5 but it still seems like a few cycles behind as far as technology.\\nIt it\\'s a Android phone I would like a phone they would most likely get updates for the length of my contract (2 years) optimum.\\nWhile I appreciate a good camera it\\'s not necessarily a deciding factor.  I\\'m looking for good processor, design, updatability, and quality screen.\\n\\nThanks for any help!\\n\\nBtw, if you can think of a better subreddit that would serve my question better I\\'m all ears.. I remember a time when Apple\\'s next product was an unknown. A mysterious promise of something newer and better. Something that would change your gadget life forever. \\n\\nAnnouncement day would be out on the horizon - about 2 weeks away. The internets would squabble over what the event is going to be about, what it isn\\'t going to be about - some would say it\\'s going to be great; others would say it\\'s going to stink bigtime. \\n\\nFlash forward to today. Currently, there are no more Apple rumors. Only full-frontal, check-out-this-youtube-video-of-the-next-big-thing product leaks. We know what the next iPhone is. We know what the next iPod touch is. We were introduced to the latest Macbook spec bump before Apple could even update the store.\\n\\nSo, does one still bother to fire up tabs for all the liveblogs on announcment day? Will we perch on the edge of our office chairs to see if Jobs has any other tricks up his sleeve?\\n\\nApple rumors are dead. Long live Apple rumors.. Hey, photo lovers\\n\\nThanks to Everyone!

Newer parent, 15 month old.  Been using our iPhone 5\\'s for pictures.  Some good, most are bad.  Busy baby is hard to get still shot of with the slow shutter speed of the iPhone.  When he was younger and just laid there sleeping, iPhone was good, not so much now.\\n\\nJust want to take pictures of my kid and family.  Nothing fancy but want a quality picture of all the big events. Inside and outside of the house.  Sick of taking picture only to see a blurry hand or no focus on the face.\\n\\nLooking at:\\nNikon D3100\\nD3200\\nD5300\\nCanon T3\\nT3i\\n\\nWilling to spend $400-700.\\n\\nIs the Amazon packaged kits with the added money for additional lens, bad, and all kinds of extras?\\n\\nNo current preference or knowledge.  Easy and good quality.\\n\\nUpdate:  purchased Sony NEZ-6 with lens combo.  E PZ 16-50 mm F3.5-5.6 and E55-210mm F4.5-6.3 OSS.  \\n\\nThanks for all the feedback. . It’s that’s time of the year again! \\n\\nWith a big camera focus on this year’s iPhone, do any of the developments feel like they will change what of iPhone photos are capable of?\\n\\nWere there things you particularly liked or didn’t like? \\n\\nI wanted to get people’s opinions because like every camera related iPhone announcement, I can’t tell what’s BS or not. . I\\'m aware that the way I\\'ve titled my post might come off weird, but I have been a client of this particular photographer for 6 years. She\\'s photographed my last 2 babies newborn portraits, milestones, birthdays, holiday minis, she even did a complimentary maternity session years ago in exchange for me modeling her new dresses and resparking her passion and allowing her to be creative. So we\\'ve been with her a while, and she has done around 10 sessions with us over the course of the last 6 years.\\n\\nWe aren\\'t rich by any means, and even at the time of us initially booking her, she was at the higher end of photographers in the area pricewise. It was ~$500 flat for 25 edited digital images, all inclusive (props, outfits, and studio setup). When we first saw her, her studio was set up in her shed on her personal property. In the time since, she moved into a small rental studio, then a larger rental studio. Her pricing remained pretty steady throughout. But she has now moved into a much larger, and beautiful third rental studio. She has undoubtedly been successful and is one of the best in the area at what she does.\\n\\nI know the last time we saw her for a session was a little awkward because she noticed I didn\\'t come for the holiday minis like I had in years past. I mentioned it was because my husband and I really wanted beach family photos that year instead of a studio setup, but she seemed hurt that we used someone else. She said something to the effect of \"Well you know I can do outdoor sessions as well\". Not short or snippy, just in passing conversation as we always were chatty and would stay and talk with her during our sessions. We adore her and get along wonderfully with her, but I know based on past conversations with her that she gets in her head when clients don\\'t return or change to use other photographers. \\n\\nWell I am expecting again and reached out to her about newborn session pricing. I anticipated a possible increase because everything has been going up with inflation, but honestly wasn\\'t sure what to expect. I haven\\'t been to see her for a while, and I am sure the new multi room studio she is in probably isn\\'t cheap. She messaged me back congratulating me and telling me all about her amazing new studio, and that she now includes hair and makeup for mom for the newborn sessions, and sent me the updated \"Investment\" list. Guys, my jaw dropped.\\n\\nI only ever have bought digital images no matter what photographer I use and I have avoided photographers with session fees and individual photo pricing like the plague. The typical going rate with this photographer was $500 for 25 edited images, and $10 per additional image. I knew she was floating around the idea a couple of years ago to switching to that type of structure with a session fee instead of a flat gallery fee. \\n\\nShe is now charging a $200 session fee that does NOT go towards the images. Her most expensive package is around $4k with prints. For just digitals, we are talking $600 for 8 pictures, $1,000 for 16 pictures, $1,700 for 24 pictures, $2,000 for 32 pictures, or $2,500 for 50 pictures.\\n\\nI can\\'t, guys. Like the cost of everything has gone up and paying bills is hard, we cannot afford $1700 + a $200 session fee ($1900) for the equivalent of what we received 3 years ago for $500. Even with the 20% off return customer discount she is offering. We are still talking about $1520 for 24 pictures instead of $500 for 25. ☹️🥲 \\n\\nIt\\'s not even an option, we can\\'t afford her anymore and she has officially priced us out, even with discount. I told her I would review her price list with my husband today and get back to her, and he reviewed it and was pretty much on the same page as me of \"Definitely not, we don\\'t have that kind of money laying around.\"\\n\\nI now have to go on the search for a new newborn photographer and have to break the news to her that we won\\'t be returning as clients. And I\\'m struggling with how to go about doing it. Would you want the client to be forthright with you that you\\'ve just become unaffordable? Like if she is successful with her pricing structure and has less clientele but is making the same or more money, good on her! Get that money and I\\'m cheering her on! But we just aren\\'t her target market anymore then and that\\'s hard for me to say that part outloud because we\\'ve been clients of hers for so long. It almost feels like a betrayal of loyalty to leave.\\n\\nHas anyone experienced similar or has successfully approached this subject with existing photographers or clients? I am going to need to search for a new photographer and need to put out a feeler post to see who else is out there in our budget, but this photographer is mutually in a lot of these local photographer groups that I intend to post in and I just think it\\'ll suck for her to see me shopping for a cheaper photographer. 😓 Any advice or suggestions, even sharing of similar experiences is appreciated!. I am looking to understand how the focal length of a DSLR works in contrast with a smartphone. I have a zoom kit lens 24-100mm and a Canon R6; when I use the 24 mm, my image is \"smaller\" than the one taken with the iPhone, even when I match the zoom to be 24mm as well. iPhone seems to have a wider filed of view but I don\\'t understand how both brands say is 24mm, do you have any technical documentation you can refer me to? Thank you. This is an update to my earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1bv6n20/zenfolioafter_16_years_utter_failure/).  I thought there was enough new info, and a warning, to warrant a new post.\\n\\nAfter more than 6 weeks trying to download my photos, i gave up.  My paid plan ends soon and they won\\'t get any more money from me.\\n\\nIn fairness, some galleries were restored and downloadable.  Thankfully, i have a rather mundane, yet precise, naming scheme that allowed me to locate my originals.  Tedious, yes, but i\\'m confident i have everything.\\n\\nThroughout these past 6+ weeks, support continued to be useless, if they responded at all.  They remain silent on my repeated requests for an extension to my paid plan due to their issues.\\n\\nTheir case number feature was short-lived.  Perhaps, due to people like me who actually contacted them (and were *very* quickly told to stop).  Considering the lack of any progress, i think it may have just been theater.\\n\\nA new **WARNING** for anyone interested:\\n\\nIn order to cancel, they refer the user to a silly chat bot.  In my case, the chat bot just went around in circles, referring me back to the help article that pointed me to the chat bot.  In other cases, the chat bot just went silent.  In desperation, i used their contact form to cancel my plan, explaining that i still cannot download photos, and eventually got confirmation.\\n\\nI got quite a kick out of the following tone-deaf snippet from their cancellation confirmation mail:\\n\\n>If necessary, please be sure to download all of your photos before your account is closed, as they will be permanently deleted.\\n\\nIt was (mostly) nice while it lasted, but wow, what a way to end things!  Good riddance, Zenfolio!. Hello!\\n\\nI\\'ve just started getting into having my iPhone photos printed using an online service - Nations Photo Lab.\\n\\nI\\'m curious - what camera settings are best for being able to print large/highest resolution photos possible?  Should I be enabling the Raw Max option for any photos that I might want to do large prints of?\\n\\nI tried uploading a Raw photo to their website to test it out and picked the largest print possible, but I still get a warning that the resolution isn\\'t even 180 dpi, so I\\'m a bit lost/confused.  Any advice would be appreciated.\\n\\nThank you!. I sort through .CR3 files daily(ie, RAW files from my Canon R6). Since updating yesterday I\\'ve noticed quite a bit of lag when using Quick Look in Finder. (selecting a file and pressing the space bar to view the file).\\n\\nHas anyone else noticed anything similar? It\\'s adding a noticeable amount of time to my daily workflow. All the newly released iPhone 16 can take 3D spatial photos.\\nYou should be able to view them on the Vision Pro as well as other 3D VR headsets.\\n\\nHowever, I feel that showing photos to someone by slapping big and sweaty VR goggles on their face isn’t ideal.\\nI have several stereoscope devices that you can just lightly place against your face to see 3D images.\\n\\nIs there a way to print the two images for each eye on the clear plastic slides and make it work with any type of stereoscope device? Thank you!. This question applies to the 48 and 50 megapixel ones too (Oppo, Pixel 8, and iPhone 16 Pro). Do the RAW files have true 48, 50, or 200 megapixel resolutions?. I paid $500 for an in home photoshoot with my baby. I told the photographer the focus of the photoshoot was the baby before they came. It’s winter and I asked what would happen for the photoshoot if it was a dark day- they said they would bring lighting to ensure best lighting for my photos.\\n\\nI got the photos back and many of the photos the baby is soft and grainy. Kind of out of focus- like it looks ok at first glance but if you zoom in at all the baby is not really clear, like you can’t see any details about his face if that makes sense. I asked the photographer why this is- I want to make large prints of these photos and have a crispy clear baby face. The photographer said it was due to the low light (it was a dark day just as expected) - they brought a flash and only used it about half the time. In the flash photos anyways the coloring is kind of blown out. They also said this can happen because sometimes the camera focuses on the wrong subject when there is multiple people in the photo (me and baby). I don’t understand really why they wouldn’t have taken the time to ensure camera is focusing properly on the right subject.\\n\\nIs this normal and right what they are saying? What can or should I do here- just accept it at is? Do I have unrealistic expectations? I just wanted really crisp photos where you can zoom in and see like the clear eyes and even eyelashes of the baby not just a fuzzy eye like my iPhone photos…\\n\\nEdited to add their explanation for the quality of photos. Note that I sent them some iPhone photos of my baby that were better quality than their photos which is why they reference the iPhone in the last paragraph:\\n\\nLow Light Performance: When photos are taken in low light, cameras can introduce a bit of noise, which can result in images appearing less sharp and detailed. This is a common challenge for many cameras, even professional ones. While I do use high-quality equipment, the performance can vary significantly based on lighting conditions. In brighter environments, the camera can capture more detail, leading to crisper images. Even with the flash light sometimes it\\'s just not enough light. That\\'s why photography studios use really big umbrella lights to make sure there is plenty of light to make the images sharp. \\n\\nFocus Issues: Sometimes, the camera may inadvertently focus on another subject in the frame rather than the intended subject. This can happen in dynamic settings, especially with multiple people present. While some photographers might choose to delete these images, I believe they can still hold sentimental value for families, which is why I include them in the gallery. You may find that some of these images resonate more than others, even if they aren\\'t technically perfect.\\n\\nImage Resolution: I always provide high-resolution versions of the photos, but the perceived quality can vary based on the conditions under which they were taken. The iPhone\\'s processing capabilities can sometimes enhance details in a way that makes them appear sharper, especially in well-lit situations. Also looks like in the iPhone images baby was closer to the camera which is also causing sharper image. \\n\\nUPDATE to add: thanks everyone so far, I understand you can give better advice seeing the photos but unfortunately I’m not comfortable posting baby on internet, so hopefully with enough description as I tried to give you can more or less get the idea.\\nYes the person had a portfolio, looking back all the images are in bright natural light, so I guess that’s the only way they can shoot, and they just picked the best ones from those types of shoots. I unfortunately wasn’t knowledgeable enough about photography before hiring them to know to look for low light photo examples. Lastly, not all photos are horrible, I’d say 10% are clear with ok lighting, 30% look ok from afar similar quality to an iPhone photo that I could have just had a friend point and shoot.\\n\\nAnother UPDATE for anyone following along:\\nThanks so much for the big turn out in this post! I’m glad to know I’m not being unreasonable. Some of you have been funny or informative and that’s so appreciated. I’ve learned a lot about what to look for when hiring someone in the future. I will not be asking for a reshoot as this was a really special photoshoot for me, my babies first Christmas, which can’t be recreated as I’ve already taken all my decorations down. I also wouldn’t even feel comfortable complaining to someone about their work and then having to sit through more photos with them (that would probably be sub par again anyways). It was a lot of money for me, and I only spent it because it felt like such a special moment in time to capture. I’m going to ask them again if maybe there are some photos that are clearer or editing that can be done to correct the issues… and then take it from there.. First of all I would like to thank everyone for their response on my previous post, to the exception of the ones who wanted me to send them the nudes. I sincerely hope you were just trolling.\\n\\n\\nI feel I need to update and give more background.\\n\\n\\nFirst of all I documented everything and went to see the police first thing in the morning. I gave them everything and told them what happened. The police officer was almost laughing seeing how pale and distressed I was. From what I understand they want to contact the mother and see what’s up. I received precise instructions regarding what was next for me. I feel relieved. \\n\\n I searched for what is considered CP where I live and it’s not really clear. The police itself was not sure when I described what I saw.\\n\\nNow a bit more context. \\n\\nI’ve done modeling for years. I have seen many many (legal) nude photographs and I’m confortable with nudity in that context, even if I have never done nudes myself. Also, I have a previous experience of a father/daughter taking pictures of each other, sometimes naked. I was in their studio as a model. The daughter was displaying her nudes on her room’s wall as she was developing the negatives herself, she was probably 16-18 yo at the time. So yeah, at first, when the mother reached out to me, her request was totally in the realms of possible shooting gig in my head. I just never questioned it (but I should have).\\n\\nShe didn’t tell me her daughter were minors initially. Which is why I engaged into more details with her. A bit later she disclosed they were. And since CP is not something I think about often (like at all) my dense self didn’t think much of it (see previous life experience). \\n\\nWhen she started being pushy about sending pictures I was weirded out but I honestly thought it came from a “I have low self esteems and maybe you don’t want to photograph me” kind of place.\\n\\nAt this point I was already telling myself that it was highly possible I would just bail on them. I just wanted to put her on hold and consult a lawyer to full proof a model release for nudity photoshoot. \\n\\nThe day after, out of the blue, she sends me those few attachments and the first few thumbnails  I see are of what appears to be her daughter taking selfie of themselves in front of the mirror, naked. \\n\\nI did not downloaded or opened the pictures, I did not see them all. It was just the automated preview feature on my email. Were the pictures sexual ? I don’t know. Again, the law is unclear. \\n\\nIn the moment, It was just a big wtf and I was like “ nope I think this may be wrong but maybe I’m just overreacting” . \\n\\nAnyway I replied to the mother that her sharing those pictures was wrong and that I was terminating everything. \\n\\nSo yeah. I’ll probably never know if it was a set up for a scam, a simple hippie family dynamic or something more sinister. \\n\\nOn my end, I learned many valuable lessons in exchange of a few very stressful days.. So after serval years of doing photography I’m finally going through with making it a business. No longer just a side hustle. I had been really wanting to do a witchy photoshoot. So I put a word out on small town USA’s Facebook page about “witchy photoshoot” for only $30. It’s not even been 24hrs since I posted it and almost all sessions are booked… I posted 20 open spots. Then I find out some chick with a iPhone is charging people $250 for a similar. I realized that so many where booking because I’m more affordable… and my portfolio is more quality. I’m so annoyed with myself for charging $30 I could have at least charged $50. Anyone else every lowball themselves this bad? Only bright side I can see it that I’m going to be making lots of contacts and building a bigger client list.\\nUPDATE\\nthank you all so much for your advice and information! I’ll definitely be raising my rates and making sure to make the most of the sessions through networking and future projects. I’ll be doing Christmas photo soon and the information I gain through this post and you all your comments have helped my plan my future projects!. I have received $100 gift from a fellow redditor who wishes to remain anonymous. Another redditor has generously offered to send a spare digital camera (I\\'m not sure of the quality). These offers are so very special, now that I can make my client\\'s holiday gift so much better than I\\'d originally anticipated (I was planning to spend about $30 on his gift). So now, photography experts - what do you recommend I do now?? Are there specific attachments I could purchase to improve the digital camera? Or are there specific applications for a smart phone? I have a total of $130 to spend.\\nTHANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!! I\\'d be lost without your wisdom.. Hey /r/photography! \\n\\n\\nLast week we\\'ve been hard at work to bring you guys Inspiration Albums.

I want to shout out http://www.prsmphoto.com/user/daveoverthere for posting a ton of good content to the site last week. \\n\\nPrism:\\n\\nwww.prsmphoto.com\\n\\nExample account:\\n\\nwww.prsmphoto.com/user/tyler\\n\\nThanks for your time!\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to give us some feedback or report an error drop us an email at info@prsmphoto.com, on our subreddit /r/prismphoto, or right here in this thread.\\n\\n/u/usremane , /u/katzey , and I will be responding to any feedback or questions.\\n\\n\\n[Last week\\'s update](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/4ehgx0/prism_update_4122016_advanced_search/). \\nI mean I use good cameras in my film class at high school, some of those canon 4k 2000$+ ones, and I just can’t believe I’m expected to pay so much money if I want something good to work with. Right now, I just use my iPhone 15 camera, and it’s good for sure, that can’t be argued, but it just doesn’t hold a candle to the cameras we use at school and I really really want one of those. \\n\\nEdit: Nevermind, I figured out that I can shoot 6k images on my base iPhone 15, when I need a new camera ima just exchange for a iPhone 16 pro max or iPhone 15 pro max . I\\'m posting this for a friend (Matthew Christopher of [Abandoned America](https://abandonedamerica.us/)) who had all of his gear stolen out of his car while heading out on his honeymoon (which is why he\\'s not posting this for himself.) A police report has been filed but the more people keeping an eye out for it the better. \\n\\nHere\\'s the stolen gear list:\\n\\n* Canon 5D Mark II S/N: 1721001938 \\n* Canon EF 16-35 2.8L S/N: 1915233\\n* Canon EF 24-70 4L\\n* Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III (he\\'s unsure if he brought this one)\\n* Sony A7R II \\n* Canon EF Lens to Sony NEX Smart Adapter (Mark III)\\n* 4x Batteries for each camera\\n* Assorted CF and SD cards\\n* ND Filter\\n\\nI\\'ll update this with more serial numbers as soon as I can. Unfortunately, his insurance is only going to cover 8%-10% because it was in a rental car. If you happen across someone selling that specific gear list (Yes, I know it\\'s very unlikely) please DM me!\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n. Felt like this was the appropriate place to get some help exposing(no oun inteded) my aunt.\\n\\nShe\\'s been claiming for years that she took the following picture was taken on her iPhone 5/6\\n\\n https://imgur.com/gallery/P1vLs\\n\\nI\\'m no photography expert, but I think there is no way she could get such a good shot of the milky way and stars even if it was taken from the Hawaiian observatory. A mobile phone camera would bring in waaaaay more noise I feel.\\n\\n\\nUPDATE:  She\\'s a liar (see top comment and reply chain)\\n\\nUPDATE #2:  I\\'ve decided to tell my mom when she gets back from her vacation on Tuesday. Set your reminders if interested\\n\\nUPDATE #3: Like I mentioned above, I planned on telling my mom tomorrow. While on my lunch I received these texts...\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/C7qrh\\n\\nThe real question remains... What\\'s my mom going to say to my aunt who she has trusted as one of her best friend since they were kids.\\n\\nThanks to all those that helped solve the case, and to the rest of you knuckleheads heads who made this thread bigger then it should have been. Untill next time.... Hi, this is gonna be long so tl;dr: had anniversary photos taken with a photographer, haven\\'t received pics when it\\'s been just over 8 weeks when she said it would be 2. My husband and I have both contacted her and she has never responded. She has a history of not responding to my sister, my sister\\'s coworker, and my mom but she\\'s taking even longer with me which is why I\\'m getting worried. When we had the photos taken I didn\\'t know until **the morning of** if we were even doing it still or what time because she wasn\\'t responding when I was asking her since all we knew was the date that was arranged about 1-2 months beforehand. I don\\'t know what else to do and what timeframe is reasonable, especially when we\\'re already 6 weeks over when she said it would be.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo here we go, I just thought this may be a place where I can get some advice from photographers because I\\'m having an issue. My husband and I had anniversary shoot just over 8 weeks ago, when we got married we did not have photos taken aside from a handful of them on my mom\\'s iPhone etc because of money and time. I regretted it so we were excited to have these photos taken, we went with a photographer my sister used a year or so ago. We paid for the shoot while she was having a big sale, the session is normally $450 and we paid $200 which I know is a really good deal, but money is still money and I paid but worry I\\'ve thrown it down the drain, worry she lost the photos or something, not sure where to go from here.  \\n\\nSo what happened was we had scheduled a date a month or two before the shoot but she didn\\'t have a time yet.  I contacted her in the days leading up to it to find out what time and if we were still on.  She did not respond until the morning of the shoot which had my husband and I very stressed.  She made up for this in person because she seemed great at what she does, we both hate having our pictures taken but she made us feel SO comfortable and I really liked her a lot.  It felt like the shoot went REALLY well and she even showed me a couple on the screen of her camera and I already loved them so far.  \\n\\nAfter the shoot she said she will email me a link to a digital gallery and it will be about 2 weeks. 2 weeks came and went, and I was trying to be very patient although I was very excited and itching to get our pictures. After a month I texted her (I don\\'t have a Facebook and she gave her cell number saying that texting it was the best way to reach her) and I asked about it and whether she had an idea of when we might be receiving them.  No response. Then a couple weeks later my husband texted her from his phone as well. No response. I texted her again a little over a week ago which was just before the 7 week mark. This time I told her I understand things get busy but I would really appreciate if she would respond so I at least know what\\'s going on. Still no response. \\n\\nI\\'m a very patient person and if I have to wait 6 months I would but I just need to know. I\\'m scared she lost the pictures or something.  My sister, her coworker, and my mom have all had communication issues with her in the past because they would message her and she just wouldn\\'t answer. It\\'s dragging out a bit longer for me though than it did for them.  I\\'m not sure what else to do because I want them to turn out great and am willing to wait for good quality, but her not answering any of our texts is really getting stressful. It\\'s getting hard to wait with no answers at all. I\\'ve been checking my email every day for so long now and it\\'s getting so disheartening. Is this something that\\'s common, how do I go about it at this point and what should I do? How long does it take to put together a gallery of pics from a 1 hr shoot? My mom said she was even tempted to go on the girl\\'s photography Facebook page and comment on a recent post asking for us so that it\\'s publicly visible hoping she will be more likely to respond but I just don\\'t know if that\\'s even worth it. Advice?\\n\\n\\nEDIT to clarify: I didn\\'t know she was like this until after we had already paid and booked her. my sister told me after that she had communication issues but since her photos turned out great she thought she was worth going through again and that\\'s how we ended up using her. My sister told me after we booked it when it was taking a while to get a response. Then my mom said she had messaged her also about booking and she wouldn\\'t respond to any of her messages. Then when I complained to her about it a month and a half after the shoot that\\'s when my sis told me about her coworker which I hadn\\'t realized happened initially either because she thought it was due to the \"family issues\" and not necessarily an issue anymore. Before you point fingers please realize that if you don\\'t know the story yet you can\\'t blame me because I did not expect any of this. I saw my sister\\'s pictures and they were so cute, and the photos she posts on social media are so nice. \\n\\nShe told my sister a year ago when they did their photos that her poor communication was due to \"family issues\" and that it had something to do with a family member having health issues. She thought since it had been a while it would be better now. She got her photos back late but not this late, and they looked really great so she didn\\'t think it would be an issue at this point due to her supposed reason behind it...\\n\\n\\nUPDATE I was finally able to get my pictures, thanks again to the people who were kind and helpful! . One of my favorite clients is asking me to edit an image then send over the dng file so she can use the preset of it in Lightroom. I have already done this once for them before but she stated that it was for her and her assistant to use for some content. I gave her the preset to use on JPEGs. It was a scaled back version of what I use on my RAWS. After that I noticed her new social media girl who shoots both videos and stills for her was using it to edit. I still get booked to shoot larger campaigns for this client but this social media girl is a direct competitor of mine she books other brands in my area and shoots both stills and video for them she’s a professional photographer not just an assistant messing around in Lightroom with an iPhone pic or two. I’m concerned she takes my style/preset to other clients and tries to say it’s hers. She already duplicates my shots and lighting and is on my tail when I’m shooting basically taking all the light/angles/poses I scouted/set up and uses it in her videos. Anyways on a recent shoot that turned out really well the client is asking for an updated preset presumably to keep her feed consistent and for the new social media girl to use. The new shoot was basically edited with a starting point of the old preset but with a few tweaks. I really don’t want to damage the relationship by saying no so I’m looking for a gracious way to educate/explain to my client or another resolution. Help! lol I feel like I’m gunna get screwed like this social media girl is going to use my preset but say it’s her work she already does do that. It’s a frustrating situation if I didn’t love this client so much I’d turn and run but the shoots we do turn out amazing and I love the creative aspect of the work. . Hey friends.\\n\\nSay I take a portrait orientation photo on my iPhone. I wish to convert it to a landscape photo, understanding this will crop off a large portion of the image. That is okay with me.\\n\\nHow can I change the aspect ratio and make a portrait photo landscape, with the exact dimensions of a standard landscape iPhone photo? \\n\\nCheers and thanks!!!\\n\\n. I\\'ve always been a matrix metering mode man myself just from familiarity but recently I\\'m thinking I should spend more time in spot metering and make use of the AEL button to choose my exposure.. Hey photo lovers,\\n\\nLast two month, I was doing a market research for my project [Photolemur](https://photolemur.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=104%20photo%20tools) and looked for different tools in the area of photo enhancement and photo editing. I spent a lot of time on search and then posted an article [61 Photo Editing Tools and Apps You Should Know About (Organized List)](https://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/4zjspd/61_photo_editing_tools_and_apps_you_should_know/). \\n\\nAfter this, I have got a lot of comments and messages with a new portion of great tools for photo editing.

Hey guys, it\\'s the 8th so it\\'s time for the Official Instagram Follow Thread! ([Last month\\'s one](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/4dw9wh/official_monthly_instagram_follow_thread/))\\n\\nI recently [gave a talk](http://david-ma.net/talks/photography#reddit) at a few universities about Photography on the Internet. The basic gist of the talks was:\\n\\n1. To improve your photography you have to [Do A Lot Of Work](http://i.imgur.com/ks3ISet.png) (from that [Ira Glass repost](https://vimeo.com/85040589))\\n\\n2. Currently one of the best ways to **do a lot of work** is Instagram. Posting photos regularly on Instagram will force you to improve your photography, it will force you decide which of your photos is worth posting, and how it should be edited, and you\\'ll see which of your photos are more well recieved by people\\'s likes/comments/feedback.\\n\\n3. Of course, don\\'t base your whole self worth as a photographer on how many followers you have on Instagram... but overall I think using Instagram is one of the very good stepping stones on *The Path of Self Improvement as a Photographer**\\n\\nOk now that the nice preamble is out of the way, here\\'s what we all came for. How can I be a MASSIVE TRYHARD at Instagram? What are the tips and tricks?\\n\\nHere\\'s a checklist of things you can do if you want to get shitloads of followers on Instagram and get paid to go on holidays etc. These are all optional, you can do as many or as few as you want, and some of these will contradict each other, so don\\'t blindly follow them - decide what your goals are and do the things that will help you reach those goals. Some of these will be high-effort, some of them will be low-effort, decide for yourself how much you can be bothered doing this list of tryhard instagram stuff.\\n\\n* **Make your account public** - you won\\'t get new followers if you\\'re private.\\n\\n* **Make a private account** - if you\\'re just sharing happy snaps for friends, make a separate private account.\\n\\n* **Have a consistent theme**, E.g. just post cityscapes, or portraits or food. You can create multiple accounts to do this.\\n\\n* **Post consistently** - Thanks /u/zakvta - Posting every day is good. I recommend no more than 3 times per day.\\n\\n* **Post during peak hour, when people are commuting** This depends on where your followers live. Post when they\\'re commuting, e.g. 7-9am and 5-7pm. At this time people will be sitting on trains and busses, looking at their phones, but they won\\'t have much to post themselves. So the ratio of viewers:posters is REALLY GOOD.\\n\\n* **Use hashtags to get featured**, E.g. [#RedditPhotography](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/redditphotography/) has no theme requirement we\\'ll just be picking photos by Redditors to feature on [@RedditPhotography](https://www.instagram.com/redditphotography/). [@TheWorldGrammers](https://www.instagram.com/theworldgrammers/) picks photos from [#TheWorldGrammers](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/theworldgrammers/) and [#twgrammers](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/twgrammers/) to feature, mostly people with interesting stories from around the world. Other feature accounts like #Instagood, #MoodyGrams, #Priime etc. also have pretty loose themes. Use local hashtags if possible, these are better than the super generic world-wide ones. E.g. [#IgersSydney](http://instagram.com/explore/tags/IgersSydney)\\n\\n* **Watermark appropriately** Having a tasteful, legible watermark that leads people back to your profile is good in case you have a photo that goes viral.\\n\\n* **Use appropriate hashtags**, It\\'s more work, but you\\'ll have better luck getting featured if you hashtag appropriately, e.g. #SydneyFolk for people in Sydney\\n\\n* **Geotag your photos** - Geotags will help people find photos... just remember NEVER tag your home!\\n\\n* **Use event hashtags** - This only really works if the organiser of the event has provided a hashtag. e.g. [#IgersSydneyCNY](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/igerssydneycny/)\\n\\n* **Participate in events**, take photos at events, talk about the events online, using twitter, instagram and blog posts afterwards. People who have met you (however briefly) are higher-quality followers than people who haven\\'t met you at all.\\n\\n* **Go to Instagram Meetups** E.g. World Wide Instameet. There are meet ups all around and it\\'s hard to give advice on this since every group is run independently.\\n\\n* **Tag your friends/get tagged by your friends** Doing things with your friends and then mentioning them in the caption is a good way to send your followers to your friends\\' profiles, and if they do the same for you, you\\'ll hopefully cross-pollinate each other\\'s Instagrams. A good way to do this is to model for your friends or to repost your friends\\' photos, perhaps saying something \"This is @Frostickle\\'s photo, with my edit\". Of course you should ask for permission before doing this. (If you post a #RedditRaw photo, you are already granted permission, but you still have to give credit.)\\n\\n* **Update your bio each week** - Keeping your bio fresh will keep people engaged in your profile.\\n\\n* **Use the link in your bio** You only get one clickable link on Instagram, use it well! Promote something with it! Your website, your twitter, your OTHER Instagram? I usually leave the link as my website until I have an event on or I have a new blog post, then I make an instagram post and tell people \"Link in my bio\"\\n\\n* **Link your twitter using IFT.TT** when you \"share to twitter\" the photo doesn\\'t show up in your twitter feed. Using [this IFTTT recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/284348-real-instagram-photos-in-twitter) will show the photo properly, [like this](https://twitter.com/frostickle/status/728502786380410880).\\n\\n* **Comment on other people\\'s stuff** - Genuine comments are best. If you can put in time to actually look at people\\'s work and say something about it and talk to them about their work, that\\'s the best engagement you can give... but if you\\'re lazy, just comment \"dope\" or \"fire\" or a jazz-hands-emoji. Remember, you only get out what you put in. And it\\'s totally ok if you don\\'t want to put in a lot of effort... just don\\'t be upset when you don\\'t get good returns on your mediocre investment.\\n\\n* **Follow people back** Unfortunately Instagram doesn\\'t have \"lists\" yet. This is where the separate \"personal\" account comes in handy. If you start interacting with thousands of people on Instagram... you\\'ll soon reach the point where you won\\'t see everyone\\'s photos. So if you want to keep tabs on all your homeboys & homegirls you will have to create a separate \"personal account\" which only follows the 100 or so people you _really care about_... Personally, I gave up on seeing everyone\\'s photos in my feed, I\\'m quite relaxed about following people back who I have a connection with - **if you\\'re a Redditor I\\'ll gladly follow you** :)\\n\\n* **Use the Reddit follow thread** - Post your username in this thread and follow other people!\\n\\n* **Turn on Post Notifications** - You can turn on post notifications for your close friends, so you don\\'t miss their posts. This is useful when you\\'re following 2000+ people like me.\\n\\n* **Take Better Photos** - Edit your photos with more than just the default Instagram app. Priime and VSCO are great phone apps. Taking photos on a REAL CAMERA, editing on your computer and dropboxing to your phone is a lot of effort, but worth it!\\n\\n* **Export at 1800px on the widest side** Thanks /u/JugglerNorbi!\\n\\n* **The highest portrait ratio is 4:5** Thanks /u/JugglerNorbi!\\n\\n* **The widest landscape ratio is 16:9** Thanks /u/JugglerNorbi!\\n\\n* **Don\\'t post your bad photos** - Use your private personal account if you must, or get [snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/add/frostickle).\\n\\n* **Write posts with advice for other redditors and then namedrop yourself all over the post** - Follow me! [@Frostickle](https://www.instagram.com/frostickle/), if I don\\'t follow you back, leave me a message saying you\\'re from reddit. Sometimes it\\'s hard to tell who is/isn\\'t from reddit.\\n\\n* **Use #RedditPhotography and #RedditRaw** Post your #RedditRaw photos on Instagram!! I want to feature them on the [@RedditPhotography](https://www.instagram.com/redditphotography/) account! Oh and follow this account too please :) :) :)\\n\\n* **Add your username in this thread, and a tip or trick** - I\\'ll collect them on a blog post on http://blog.redditphotography.com/ or something.\\n\\n*Regarding: \"The Path of Self Improvement as a Photographer\": Learn the basics of \"aperture, shutter speed & ISO\", Pick up a film camera so you learn to slow down and frame your shots, Use Instagram to force yourself to \"do work\" every day/week/month, Similarly, print something every month/year. etc. Oh man I should really do a blog post about this stuff too... But it would be hard to not just copy+paste /r/photoclass_2016. * [Stolen Photo](http://instagram.com/p/YVlUgRKVpG/)\\n* [Screenshot of her original post 17 minutes after posting](http://imgur.com/Iv9VUJr) It would eventually receive 200 congratulatory comments and 10,000 \"likes\" before removal. \\n* [Original Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/daves-f-stop/8076246372/in/set-72157630953089238/)\\n* This kind of thing is obviously very common on Instagram, but a user with a quarter of million followers should have responsibility to at least credit the original photographer and not let them assume the photographs were taken by her. \\n* **When I wrote her to credit Dave Morrow, I was blocked**\\n* Hopefully we can get her to credit him. I prefer this to not turn into a witch hunt\\n* UPDATE 4pm Sunday: Stolen Photo has been removed. No mention of the incident or crediting Photographer\\n* [ALL OF \"HER PHOTOS\" CAN BE SEEN HERE](http://instagram.com/linda_1312)\\n* UPDATE A response to an additional inquiry to the Dave Morrow photo with a second instagram account \"@theradclad yes, I admit that pic I posted was Dave Morrow but that was by accident as I was tipsy from my bday celebration. My friend sent the pic for me to use as a homepage wallpaper for my new iphone. I realized the next morning and deleted it.

If you see my other posts I credit All ppl who I edit for.\"\\n* **When I asked why users who pointed out this error were blocked, the conversation was deleted. Blocked again, and then Instagram deleted my account**\\n* \\n* UPDATE- MONDAY 4PM\\n* She has taken down the stolen image, deleted all evidence of it\\'s existence, and is now claiming she is being bullied. \\n* Message from Dave Morrow photographer: *\"Hey thanks for bringing this to my attention, I really appreciate it:) Stealing digital images has become a huge problem lately especially since social networks have become such a big thing. I hate to watermark my photos but it is almost becoming necessary. In the case of Instagram the watermark would just get cropped anyway I guess\"*\\n* Thank you reddit, You guys really came through on this one!\\n* **We may have won the battle, but we are losing the war.**. Original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1fwaev/canon_1635_f28_l_front_barrel_looseanybody_had/).\\n\\nThis week I found that the lens would focus automatically, but the focus ring wouldn\\'t turn in manual focus.\\n\\nA little googling on this new problem, led me to discover that there is a screw underneath the rubber focus grip, and that it might be loose.\\n\\nLo-and-behold, this was the case. Tightening the screw has fixed the manual focus issue and the front barrel is now as tight as when the lens was new!\\n\\nI\\'m happy because I feel as if 5 minutes with a screwdriver has saved me at least a couple of hundred dollars....if not a new lens!. I recently had a collaborative job with another photographer for my full time employer. He handed me over files to bundle our photos for handover and his work was awful. Bad colours, out of focus and banding in the skies. Bad framing etc. Just all round sub standard. I spent a full day editing his work because we split up the work i had to use his photos too. \\nI had a look through his online portfolio and connected on LinkedIn and he constantly posts bad photos with his logo on them. However he\\'s good at business and has been a professional photographer for 30 years and does so many jobs freelance.\\nI just can\\'t believe how confident he is putting out substandard work. \\nIts something we can all be guilty of but this was on another level of bad. \\n\\nI started out in photography straight from school and by the time I was 22 I thought I was amazing. I look back now 16 years later and laugh at my mediocre photography and cock sure confidence. I\\'m now 10 times more skilled and experienced but with only half the confidence.\\nHas anyone else come across photographer like this at professional level?\\n\\nIn short I worked with a photographer who\\'s bad but doesn\\'t seem to know it.\\n\\nUpdate/Clarifications:\\nThank you for all your stories and opinions. This has been an interesting topic. \\n\\nHe is a skilled and experienced business man. Reliable and affordable.  He was also a lovely guy.\\n\\nHis technical photography skills are objectively bad. Out of focus, over exposed images, random white ballance, awkward framing etc.\\n\\n I did not criticise his work because I disliked his \"style\". I edited the photos he sent, as was agreed. I needed them for the project. I recovered blown out highlights as much as possible (they were bad), reframed and corrected white balance. I didn\\'t \"restyle\" them. And he sent jpegs of his best photos from the shoot. No RAW images. I think he shot jpeg. \\n\\nHe showcases his work constantly on linked, Instagram and his website. It is almost all the same standard. He always puts his logo on them. Therefore I assume he believes it is a good enough standard for a professional photographer which as far as I can see is the definition of the Dunning-Kruger effect. I\\'m sure lots of people and clients are happy with his work and tell him so. \\n\\nA professional is some one who gets paid for their work. It is not an immediate recognition of skill and ability despite people expecting it to be. . **TLDR**: Sometime in 2023, I left a low rating of a product purchased on Adorama. It appears that Adorama has suppressed my negative review, as this product currently still has only 5 stars and my low review is still nowhere to be seen 6+ months later. I emailed asking why my review appears to have been suppressed, and in every way possible, customer service has dodged and deferred the question.\\xa0\\n\\nI’m sharing this lack of transparency with fellow photographers as the ethics involved are questionable at best and really makes me question any and all reviews or ratings on their website. Do better Adorama.\\xa0\\n\\n**FULL VERSION**: I purchased a H&Y RevoRing 52-72mm Variable Adapter from Adorama back on 16 May 2022 then shortly thereafter left the country and traveled for roughly the next year and a half overseas. I brought this product with me and, conceptually, it’s great. No more step up rings. The problem was execution and this would simply spin when threaded onto my lens, risking losing not only the adapter but possibly an expensive filter as well. I contacted H&Y upon my return back stateside and they couldn’t be bothered to even respond. Because of this faulty product and zero customer service, I felt like it was relevant information to share with other potential buyers, so I left a review on Adorama (ironically, at their request).\\xa0\\n\\nFast forward until April 2024 and was curious whether anyone else had similar experiences. To my surprise, my review was nowhere to be found and this product somehow maintains 9x 5-star reviews. I attempted to leave another review to warn future buyers, but Adorama prevented my second review from being submitted with a popup saying, “Thanks, we already have your review for this item”. So they acknowledge my account submitted a review, yet it’s not live?\\xa0\\n\\nNow 6+ months after my initial review submission, I emailed customer service on 20 April 2024 and asked why it appears that my low review is being suppressed. After more than a few back and forths with Randy Q., I never received any answer why my review was suppressed. Here’s the conversation below:\\n\\n* **Me (20 April 2024)**: Hi, I\\'m wondering why my low review is being suppressed? This product shows only 5 stars reviews which is not accurate. I was not happy with the product nor the MFG customer service. I\\'m attempting to share this experience as Adorama requests its customers do. When I attempt to leave another review, I\\'m blocked from doing so and it says that I\\'ve already submitted a review. It would be great if listings were honest and forthright, instead of suppressing low reviews.\\n* **Adorama (21 April 2024)**: We are sorry to hear that the item you received is not working as expected. I have made a note on this specific order about your honest review. Again, I\\'m sorry for any inconvenience.\\n* **Me (22 April 2024)**: I don\\'t mean to be pushy or rude, but this didn\\'t answer my question as to why my review does not show on the listing. Reviews are necessary to warn other buyers, so it still appears to me that my review is being suppressed so that other buyers are not made aware of any issues. Can you please explain why my review is not present on the listing?\\n* **Adorama (25 April 2024)**: We are sorry for the delay response. I have already requested and forwarded your bad reviews to our management. Again, we are sorry for any inconvenience. Thank you for shopping with us, we appreciate your business.\\n* **Me (26 April 2024)**: I don\\'t mean to continue to push this, but my question remains unanswered. Why is my review not public? Forwarding reviews and feedback to management doesn\\'t help other customers make informed buying decisions. I would really appreciate a direct response to the question above.\\n* **Adorama (1 May 2024)**: I\\'m sorry for the delay response. Please be advised that we have already reported your review to our web department; we are just waiting for it to be checked and posted on our website as you requested. Please allow 1-2 business days for an update. Thank you for shopping with us, we appreciate your business.\\n* **Me (3 May 2024)**: I\\'m just letting you know that I\\'ll be sharing this incredibly disappointing experience with fellow photographers on Reddit. With Adorama being such a large and trusted name within the photography industry, people should know that reviews and customer feedback are being manipulated. My inquiry was submitted on 20 April 2024 and it\\'s now 2 weeks later. My initial review was left on Adorama about a YEAR ago - sometime in 2023. Clearly, for whatever reason, Adorama is suppressing negative reviews. Whether it\\'s to drive sales or something else. As someone who relies upon reviews to make my purchasing decisions, this is incredibly concerning and disappointing. It\\'s also incredibly unethical. My review was honest, straightforward, and the product purchased directly from Adorama. I am sharing my personal experience with a faulty product, yet my original and honest low review from 2023 is not visible. It should\\'ve gone live A YEAR AGO (or whenever I submitted it in 2023), yet this product consists currently of entirely 5 stars. Why we\\'re currently in the middle of this \"I\\'ve forwarded to my management\" and \"I\\'ve made a note on this specific order\" dance is beyond me. Now it\\'s become something larger than just my individual review on a poorly made Chinese product being sold on your website. It makes me question how transparent Adorama\\'s entire business model is. If Adorama is willing to deceive customers with a single listing, what\\'s to stop them on all of them? Where does Adorama draw the line with regards to customer deception? At this point, you can disregard my feedback on this single listing. If you\\'d like to respond to my overall question about transparency as a whole, my ears are still open. If management would like to chime in, keep an eye on Reddit for an upcoming post titled something to the effect of \"Adorama is suppressing negative reviews\".\\n* **Adorama (5 May 2024)**: I\\'m really sorry for the waiting time in regards to the posting of your review on your website. Please be advised that the web department is now working on it, and you can also make your own by using the \\'Write a Review\\' link on the website under the \\'Review\\' section of the product listing online.\\n\\nFor the life of me, I can’t understand why they would suppress the review, unless they either suppress low reviews in general, or have a deal worked out with this Chinese company. The review was in no way derogatory, it simply explained the product usage, my concerns, and the lack of response from the manufacturer. In either situation, this entire experience has really put me off of Adorama. I can’t say I’m a huge spender there, but I’ve purchased multiple lenses, camera bodies, drones, film, and accessories. Historically never had any problems, but guess any future purchases will be done at B&H, or literally anywhere that’s not Adorama. Manipulated reviews are just not something I want to support and I hope others will share this sentiment.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd just for the record, I purchased a 2nd one of these H&Y adapters off Amazon just to try 1.5 years later and it had the same problems.\\n\\nJust wanted to share this experience since I found it very problematic. Considering one will likely have multiple options for purchasing your camera gear, be selective as to who you give your money to. The fact that their final recommendation was to leave a review was the icing on the cake. Thanks Randy Q and Adorama.\\n\\nI\\'ve included screenshots of the email exchange via link, as I can\\'t upload photos directly to this post. . ~~~~Post your Instagram or Flickr or whatever other feed you have here, and take a look at other people\\'s feeds too!

So the ratio of viewers:posters is REALLY GOOD.\\n\\n* **Use hashtags to get featured**, E.g. [#RedditPhotography](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/redditphotography/) has no theme requirement we\\'ll just be picking photos by Redditors to feature on [@RedditPhotography](https://www.instagram.com/redditphotography/). [@TheWorldGrammers](https://www.instagram.com/theworldgrammers/) picks photos from [#TheWorldGrammers](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/theworldgrammers/) and [#twgrammers](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/twgrammers/) to feature, mostly people with interesting stories from around the world. Other feature accounts like #Instagood, #MoodyGrams, #Priime etc. also have pretty loose themes. Use local hashtags if possible, these are better than the super generic world-wide ones. E.g. [#IgersSydney](http://instagram.com/explore/tags/IgersSydney)\\n\\n* **Watermark appropriately** Having a tasteful, legible watermark that leads people back to your profile is good in case you have a photo that goes viral.\\n\\n* **Use appropriate hashtags**, It\\'s more work, but you\\'ll have better luck getting featured if you hashtag appropriately, e.g. #SydneyFolk for people in Sydney\\n\\n* **Geotag your photos** - Geotags will help people find photos... just remember NEVER tag your home!\\n\\n* **Use event hashtags** - This only really works if the organiser of the event has provided a hashtag. e.g. [#IgersSydneyCNY](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/igerssydneycny/)\\n\\n* **Participate in events**, take photos at events, talk about the events online, using twitter, instagram and blog posts afterwards. People who have met you (however briefly) are higher-quality followers than people who haven\\'t met you at all.\\n\\n* **Go to Instagram Meetups** E.g. World Wide Instameet. There are meet ups all around and it\\'s hard to give advice on this since every group is run independently.\\n\\n* **Tag your friends/get tagged by your friends** Doing things with your friends and then mentioning them in the caption is a good way to send your followers to your friends\\' profiles, and if they do the same for you, you\\'ll hopefully cross-pollinate each other\\'s Instagrams. A good way to do this is to model for your friends or to repost your friends\\' photos, perhaps saying something \"This is @Frostickle\\'s photo, with my edit\". Of course you should ask for permission before doing this. (If you post a #RedditRaw photo, you are already granted permission, but you still have to give credit.)\\n\\n* **Update your bio each week** - Keeping your bio fresh will keep people engaged in your profile.\\n\\n* **Use the link in your bio** You only get one clickable link on Instagram, use it well! Promote something with it! Your website, your twitter, your OTHER Instagram? I usually leave the link as my website until I have an event on or I have a new blog post, then I make an instagram post and tell people \"Link in my bio\"\\n\\n* **Link your twitter using IFT.TT** when you \"share to twitter\" the photo doesn\\'t show up in your twitter feed. Using [this IFTTT recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/284348-real-instagram-photos-in-twitter) will show the photo properly, [like this](https://twitter.com/frostickle/status/728502786380410880).\\n\\n* **Comment on other people\\'s stuff** - Genuine comments are best. If you can put in time to actually look at people\\'s work and say something about it and talk to them about their work, that\\'s the best engagement you can give... but if you\\'re lazy, just comment \"dope\" or \"fire\" or a jazz-hands-emoji. Remember, you only get out what you put in. And it\\'s totally ok if you don\\'t want to put in a lot of effort... just don\\'t be upset when you don\\'t get good returns on your mediocre investment.\\n\\n* **Follow people back** Unfortunately Instagram doesn\\'t have \"lists\" yet. This is where the separate \"personal\" account comes in handy. If you start interacting with thousands of people on Instagram... you\\'ll soon reach the point where you won\\'t see everyone\\'s photos. So if you want to keep tabs on all your homeboys & homegirls you will have to create a separate \"personal account\" which only follows the 100 or so people you _really care about_... Personally, I gave up on seeing everyone\\'s photos in my feed, I\\'m quite relaxed about following people back who I have a connection with - **if you\\'re a Redditor I\\'ll gladly follow you** :)\\n\\n* **Use the Reddit follow thread** - Post your username in this thread and follow other people!\\n\\n* **Turn on Post Notifications** - You can turn on post notifications for your close friends, so you don\\'t miss their posts. This is useful when you\\'re following 2000+ people like me.\\n\\n* **Take Better Photos** - Edit your photos with more than just the default Instagram app. Priime and VSCO are great phone apps. Taking photos on a REAL CAMERA, editing on your computer and dropboxing to your phone is a lot of effort, but worth it!\\n\\n* **Export at 1800px on the widest side** Thanks /u/JugglerNorbi!\\n\\n* **The highest portrait ratio is 4:5** Thanks /u/JugglerNorbi!\\n\\n* **The widest landscape ratio is 16:9** Thanks /u/JugglerNorbi!\\n\\n* **Don\\'t post your bad photos** - Use your private personal account if you must, or get [snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/add/frostickle).\\n\\n* **Write posts with advice for other redditors and then namedrop yourself all over the post** - Follow me! [@Frostickle](https://www.instagram.com/frostickle/), if I don\\'t follow you back, leave me a message saying you\\'re from reddit. Sometimes it\\'s hard to tell who is/isn\\'t from reddit.\\n\\n* **Use #RedditPhotography and #RedditRaw** Post your #RedditRaw photos on Instagram!! I want to feature them on the [@RedditPhotography](https://www.instagram.com/redditphotography/) account! Oh and follow this account too please :) :) :)\\n\\n* **Add your username in this thread, and a tip or trick** - I\\'ll collect them on a blog post on http://blog.redditphotography.com/ or something.\\n\\n*Regarding: \"The Path of Self Improvement as a Photographer\": Learn the basics of \"aperture, shutter speed & ISO\", Pick up a film camera so you learn to slow down and frame your shots, Use Instagram to force yourself to \"do work\" every day/week/month, Similarly, print something every month/year. etc. Oh man I should really do a blog post about this stuff too... But it would be hard to not just copy+paste /r/photoclass_2016. Hi Photography, \\n\\n[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/5lmsze/i_made_a_plugin_for_lightroom_to_show_which_focus/) | [Focus Points Plugin](https://github.com/musselwhizzle/Focus-Points)\\n\\n2 months ago I posted about an [open sourced Lightroom plugin](https://github.com/musselwhizzle/Focus-Points) that I made. The plugin lets you see which focus points were selected/active when then photo was taken. When the plugin first launched it was only available for the Nikon D7200. I\\'ve got some cool updates to share with you. \\n\\n\\nSince then, the plugin now supports all recent cameras from Canon, Panasonic, Fuji, Olympus, Fuji, and iphone/ipad. In terms of Nikon, it only supports a handful right now of D7100, D7200, D700, D800 (possibly D810 and D800E), D5500, D5300, D5200. The reason why Nikon is harder to support is the other camera makers (Canon, Fuji, etc) dynamically add the focus point information into the metadata of the image as an x/y pixel point. Nikon doesn\\'t do that. They say something like B6. So I need a look up chart of what B6 x/y pixel point means and that can vary per camera. In terms of Sony, I\\'m really not sure what they do so no support for them yet. Anyway, if you were interested in the plugin and couldn\\'t try it out last time because your camera wasn\\'t supported there a really good chance it is now! In addition to more camera support, there\\'s other new cool features. There is face detection (if your camera supports it), the focus point scales so it stays true if you crop the photo, focus point rotates if you rotate the photo, and different focus points graphics indicating if the camera achieved locked focus. In addition to that, there\\'s a full metadata viewer that comes with the plugin. \\n\\n\\nHere\\'s the catch and I\\'m asking for something from you Reddit. The plugin only works on Mac. I\\'ve tried everything I can possibly think of to get it working on Windows. Lightroom plugins are horribly buggy on Windows and I\\'ve exhausted all ideas. [Here\\'s the bug report ticket](https://github.com/musselwhizzle/Focus-Points/issues/70) of what I\\'ve tried and the issue. If someone out there is a dev and works on windows and would like to to tackle this, I\\'m definitely open to it. \\n\\nThanks for reading. And you mac users, hope you can enjoy the plugin. :). Since Instagram\\'s recent update, the profile feed no longer displays posts as square; instead, they appear in a 4:5 ratio. I\\'m struggling to find a way to adjust Reels so they look good both in the Reels section and on the Feed.\\n\\nInstagram allows you to manually adjust the preview for Feed posts, which is great. However, when uploading a 9:16 cover image for a Reel, the Feed view crops it awkwardly, applying some sort of zoom that cuts off the sides—even though the width measurements should technically match.\\n\\nHas anyone figured out how to make the proportions work seamlessly for both spaces? It’s tricky to explain without visuals, but I hope this makes sense.\\n\\nThanks in advance!. Hey people! It\\'s the 8th so it\\'s time for the Official Instagram Follow Thread! ([Last month\\'s one](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/56gnqr/official_monthly_instagram_follow_thread/))\\n\\nI recently [gave a talk](http://david-ma.net/talks/photography#reddit) at a few universities about Photography on the Internet. The basic gist of the talks was:\\n\\n1. To improve your photography you have to [Do A Lot Of Work](http://i.imgur.com/ks3ISet.png) (from that [Ira Glass repost](https://vimeo.com/85040589))\\n\\n2. Currently one of the best ways to **do a lot of work** is Instagram. Posting photos regularly on Instagram will force you to improve your photography, it will force you decide which of your photos is worth posting, and how it should be edited, and you\\'ll see which of your photos are more well recieved by people\\'s likes/comments/feedback.\\n\\n3. Of course, don\\'t base your whole self worth as a photographer on how many followers you have on Instagram... but overall I think using Instagram is one of the very good stepping stones on *The Path of Self Improvement as a Photographer**\\n\\nOk now that the nice preamble is out of the way, here\\'s what we all came for. How can I be a MASSIVE TRYHARD at Instagram? What are the tips and tricks?\\n\\nHere\\'s a checklist of things you can do if you want to get shitloads of followers on Instagram and get paid to go on holidays etc. These are all optional, you can do as many or as few as you want, and some of these will contradict each other, so don\\'t blindly follow them - decide what your goals are and do the things that will help you reach those goals. Some of these will be high-effort, some of them will be low-effort, decide for yourself how much you can be bothered doing this list of tryhard instagram stuff.\\n\\n* **Make your account public** - you won\\'t get new followers if you\\'re private.\\n\\n* **Make a private account** - if you\\'re just sharing happy snaps for friends, make a separate private account.\\n\\n* **Have a consistent theme**, E.g. just post cityscapes, or portraits or food. You can create multiple accounts to do this.\\n\\n* **Post consistently** - Thanks /u/zakvta - Posting every day is good. I recommend no more than 3 times per day.\\n\\n* **Post during peak hour, when people are commuting** This depends on where your followers live. Post when they\\'re commuting, e.g. 7-9am and 5-7pm.

But it would be hard to not just copy+paste /r/photoclass_2016. UPDATE:\\n\\nThey have finally now refunded me, after a lot of frustrating emails a external fraud security team accepted that it was not scanned after being passed from their warehouse to the courier. They accepted the claim and will send a refund.\\n\\nThis is my first experience dealing with MPB and while I would normally buy used to save a bit, I feel as their T&Cs are a bit dodgy and by offloading the blame onto the buyer rather than themselves I am going to avoid buying from them in the future, sorry MPB..\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\n\\n\\nHi guys.\\n\\nI am looking for some advice on what to do.\\n\\nI purchased a 27MM Fuji prime lens from MPB UK on the 10/03. They sent a follow up email saying they dispatched it later that day, which included a tracking number.\\n\\nThe courier is Evri and for those of you not in the UK, just to fill you in they are famously terrible for reliability. I checked back in every day to see when they expected it would be delivered. As of the 18/03 it still says they are expecting the package from the seller.\\n\\nI have had experiences sometimes with their tracking being quite slow to update and being stuck at depots for a while etc. But this one didn\\'t seem right. I emailed MPB on the 16/03 and they looked into it, they found that their dispatch team had sent it out to Evri and the thinking is that it has been stolen or gone missing.\\n\\nBecause I was a bit late in getting back to them, they have told me that they can\\'t open a claim for me and that I need to contact my local authorities. I am truly lost with what to do, I can\\'t contact Evri as their automated bot won\\'t let me get in touch with anyone as the parcel is still apparently with the seller.\\n\\nFor those of you interested here is their response:\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\nI have reached out to our Dispatch team regarding this, who confirmed that this was dispatched, and passed to EVRi on 10/03/25.\\n\\nHowever, according to the courier\\'s records, we are beyond the timeframe for initiating a successful investigation.\\n\\n\\ufeffAs outlined in our Terms and Conditions, we do need to be contacted within 5 calendar days regarding any lost or damaged items. This process is clearly outlined in our Terms and Conditions, as well as our online Help Articles.\\n\\n\\ufeff\\u200b\\ufeff\\ufeffAt this time, we strongly advise pursuing an investigation with your local authorities, as the item may have been stolen. We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused and please do not hesitate to reach out if you require further assistance\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\nAny advise is much appreciated!!. Sorry for the confusing title, I didn\\'t know how to summarize\\n\\nI would like to ask your opinion about default mode photo\\'s resolution and how smartphones add limitations if we choose to shoot with higher megapixels modes\\n\\nYesterday, in the store, I was doing some tests with the Samsung S25 Ultra. In default mode it takes 12MP photos and all functions are active. However, switching to 50mp and 200mp mode, some functions get disabled and it is more difficult to take quality photos (for example: if there is a light source, it will be more likely to be over exposed)\\n\\nThe Iphone 16 pro max has the same problem: switching from 24MP to 48MP mode, it has the same shortcomings, especially with light sources (although to a lesser degree)... however, at least, the default mode with all options active is 25MP, twice as much as the classic 12 of the Samsung and other models\\n\\nFor me, this is crucial in choosing a phone... and I can\\'t understand why no one talks about it\\n\\nFor example, I would be more tempted to buy the Samsung or even Vivo x200 pro... however, both, in default mode, shoot at 12MP and this can be limiting if I\\'m forced to use it to shoot e.g. backlight\\n\\nThen, of course, for Instagram 12MP is enough... but I would like a resolution that would allow acceptable prints\\n\\nSo... what\\'s you opinion on the matter? Thanks for reading. I waited 2+ hours for a first time client today. He arrived shortly after I left and in reality I could’ve turned around but I just disrespected at that point and didn’t even feel like being polite/professional towards this person anymore. Was I wrong?. Hey everyone, I’m a rookie concert photographer looking to invest in my first zoom lens for shooting small/medium concerts and events. I have a Sony A6400 (crop sensor) and recently shot a show with a rented Sony 16-35mm f/2.8 (effective 24-50mm), which worked well but felt a bit limiting for certain shots.\\n\\nI’m looking for a versatile zoom lens that balances:\\n\\t•\\tLow-light performance (since concerts are dimly lit)\\n\\t•\\tDecent reach (for small/medium venues)\\n\\t•\\tGood image quality (without breaking the bank). \\n\\nUpdate: my budget is about $900 CAD ($630 USD)\\n\\nWould love to hear what lenses you recommend, especially if you shoot concerts on a crop sensor!. Hi all, \\n\\nI hope it’s ok to post this here. I also posted on apple-dedicated subs, but I think it might be useful to ask here as well. \\n\\nTL;DR: Apple’s website claims the iPhone 15 Plus has “0.5x, 1x, and 2x optical zoom,” but multiple Apple reps have said the 2x zoom is “high-quality digital zoom.” The phone only has two lenses (0.5x and 1x), and I don’t see how true optical zoom is possible without a dedicated telephoto lens. Am I misunderstanding something?\\n\\nETA: thanks for all your insights. I’m aware this is a very long post, but thought it’d be easier to include what I’ve already done some research on. If you only want to read (1) and (5), that should give an overall idea of my issue here. All “paragraphs” have a title though, so that everyone can decide whether they want to read that extra info or not in order to answer :)\\n_____________\\n\\nI’m currently using an iPhone 12 Pro Max and looking to upgrade my phone, but I’ve hit a frustrating roadblock with my research on the iPhone 15 Plus. I’ve been trying to clarify a potential issue with the 15 Plus’s camera functionality and Apple’s advertising claims. After several hours of back-and-forth with Apple representatives (transferred between the pre-sales and tech support departments), I’ve ended up more confused than when I started. I realize this might stem from my lack of technical understanding, which is why I’m here asking for help. I genuinely don’t want to come across as entitled or complaining—this is just me trying to make an informed decision.\\n\\nHere’s what I’m grappling with:  \\n\\n(1) Apple’s website claims the iPhone 15 Plus offers “2x optical zoom” along with 0.5x and 1x optical zoom. Yet the phone only has two lenses (at least from what I can see):  \\n  - A 0.5x ultra-wide lens.  \\n  - A 1x wide lens.  \\n\\n(2). The Contradictions in Apple’s Responses – Here’s where it gets tricky:  \\n- One rep confirmed it’s “high-quality digital zoom” (not optical).  \\n- Another rep mentioned “optical-quality zoom,” which again, is not true optical zoom.  \\n- Apple’s website explicitly says “2x optical zoom,” which is misleading if it’s actually digital zoom.  \\n\\n(3) My Understanding of Telephoto lenses vs Optical vs. Digital Zoom:\\n- As we all know, optical zoom involves the physical adjustment of lenses to magnify a subject, retaining high quality.  \\n- Digital zoom crops the image and digitally enlarges it, resulting in potential quality loss (even if Apple’s tech minimizes this).  \\n- Telephoto zoom relies on fixed telephoto lenses. For example, my 12 Pro Max has:  0.5x ultra-wide lens, 1x wide lens, 2.5x telephoto lens. I might be wrong here but from what I understand, since the telephoto lens, is fixed, it needs to be a dedicated lens. In this case a specific lens dedicated to 2.5x “zoom”.  In other words I believe you can’t have telephoto zoom without a specific telephoto lens (again, I might be wrong). \\n\\n(4) My Current Understanding (Please Correct Me if I’m Wrong): \\n- If the iPhone 15 Plus lacks a dedicated 2x telephoto lens or similar extra lenses for variable optical zoom beyond 1x, I don’t see how it can offer true optical zoom at 2x.  \\n- Even if we assume some advanced tech allows for optical zoom beyond the fixed lens options, wouldn’t that require at least one lens capable of physically zooming? A 1x lens that digitally zooms to 2x would still be digital zoom, no matter how good the quality.  \\n\\n(5) So here’s my main question: Can You Have Optical Zoom Beyond Your Dedicated Lenses?\\n- Is it even possible to achieve 2x optical zoom when there isn’t a dedicated 2x telephoto lens?  \\n- My understanding is that optical zoom adjusts multiple lens elements to achieve magnification. If the iPhone 15 Plus only has 0.5x and 1x lenses, where is the 2x optical zoom coming from?  \\n\\nAt this point, I’m either severely misunderstanding some technical concepts, or this is just a false advertising class-action waiting to happen. \\n\\nSo I’m posting here to ask:  \\n- Is it possible to have more optical zoom options than there are dedicated lenses? (e.g., can a 1x lens somehow provide a true 2x optical zoom?). I understand that a 2x non-fixed lens could optically zoom out to 1x, but I’m not so sure the opposite is also true. \\n- Am I misunderstanding something fundamental about how optical zoom or telephoto lenses work?  \\n- Has anyone else noticed this apparent contradiction between Apple’s marketing and the actual capabilities of their cameras?  \\n\\nIf this is genuinely misleading advertising, how should I escalate this further with Apple? I’d appreciate any insight!  \\n_________\\n\\nSome additional info to clarify:\\n\\n(A) Why I’m considering a 15 plus:\\n- I don’t want to switch to the 16 Pro Max, because it’s out of my budget, especially since I need a lot of storage (which makes it even pricier).  \\n- Older Pro Max models between the 12 and 16 have been discontinued, and I can’t find them new and unlocked from resellers.  \\n- I could go for a Pro, which has the three-camera system, but I don’t want to sacrifice the larger display (even if the size difference isn’t huge).  \\n- The 15 Plus seems to check all the boxes for me except one: true optical zoom.\\n\\n(B) I use my optical zoom a lot, so it’s important for me to have a true optical zoom option, not just a high-quality digital approximation. While I am fully aware that Apple’s tech might make the difference almost (if not completely) imperceptible, I still value the idea of true optical zoom. \\n\\n(C) here are some of the (contradictory) explanations I’ve gotten from representatives. I understand this might be a highly technical question that they may not be qualified to answer, but the inconsistencies in their answers are getting me confused:\\n\\nOne rep said  “Sure. The iPhone 15 Plus have advance dual camera system in which by intelligently integrating hardware and software, an additional 2x Telephoto option gives users three optical-quality zoom levels — 0.5x, 1x, 2x — for the first time on an iPhone dual-camera system. A new 48MP Main camera takes stunning photos with incredible image quality and details.” And then “It would be an actual zoom between which you can switch” and also “The advanced camera system designed to help users take fantastic photos of everyday moments in their lives. A powerful 48MP Main camera enables super-high-resolution photos and a new 2x Telephoto option to give users a total of three optical zoom levels — like having a third camera. The iPhone 15 lineup also introduces the next generation of portraits, making it easier to capture portraits with great detail and low-light performance” \\n\\nAnother rep said “it\\'s essentially a high-quality digital zoom rather than a true optical zoom” as well as “I can see how that can a little misleading- the quality is very close to optical zoom!” And “it\\'s not the same mechanism.” What is interesting to me about this specific conversation is that I showed him my conversation with the previous agent and this one replied “In the tech specifics the camera is label as \"optical quality zoom\"”. I replied “Where are these publicly available tech specs? I’d appreciate it if you could tell me where to find them” and he said “Right. Everything is summarized on the website which is why there are things like tech specs pages that give you details.” I kindly asked him to send me the link so I could inspect it myself, and he sent me this link: https://www.apple.com/iphone-15/specs/ \\nInterestingly enough, that webpage also says “2x optical zoom in, 2x optical zoom out; 4x optical zoom range“. When I pointed that out, he transferred me to tech support. \\n\\nAnd then this new person wouldn’t answer my question at all. When I asked specifically “is it optical zoom or not” he just said “yes it is”. Then i was transferred again. \\n\\nAnd after that I decided to call them and spent an hour and 15 minutes having a very similar (but more frustrating) back and-forth, and still haven’t had any definitive answers, so I thought I might as well just take my chances and ask here.\\n_____\\n\\nIf anyone here can shed light on this or help me make sense of Apple’s claims, I’d be incredibly grateful. Thanks!!. I\\'m a novice, but I have the following old digital cameras: Canon PowerShot Sx30is, Sony Ilce 7m2 \\nI love taking sunset and sky pics, but the night sky ones never come out. I am going on a trip and want a compact camera for wildlife, but mostly NIGHT sky ✨🌙. I don\\'t want to worry about lugging lenses or gear right now. I also would like it to have a built-in flash and be easy to use. My hands are unsteady, so something with stability features would be helpful. Also, ease of use: I\\'m not the best with directions lol. Looking for a suggestions for a new camera or help share why I should take one of these and how to get good sky pics! I really would prefer more compact new. I would prefer not to spend 1200 but if it will get me the pics I have always dreamed to capture and in a compact size id go for it. Please help me \\nThank you! \\nLinks ideally for quick delivery from Amazon would be great and additionally helpful! . Hello! This is both a question and commentary, as I\\'m hoping to finally solve a dilemma that\\'s bothered me all year.\\n\\nI have a library nearing the ballpark of a 200,000\\\\* photos and videos of all formats (including RAW and heic) that I\\'ve built over the last decade. Nowadays, I edit with [Capture One](https://www.captureone.com/), which is fantastic, but not very useful for importing (lack of options), culling (slow render), and especially cataloging (breaks down with more than a year\\'s worth of photos). I do not yet have a NAS, and store everything on two USB HDDs — broke artist with ancient-ish mac arch etc etc. Maybe I’m just picky, but it seems like there’d be a better way.\\n\\nSo began the quest to find software that could organize and show my photos. What\\'s the use of thousands of photos if it takes too long to look at any of them? My POIs were importing (copying files from source to library, sorting by year/month, detecting duplicates), culling (rate, color tag, keywords, and preview speed in full view), and catalog (fast gallery thumbnails, albums, sorting, small data size). Here\\'s what I\\'ve found thus far:\\n\\n-[Lightroom](https://lightroom.adobe.com/): Does it all, but I hate it. Overpriced, lacks some professional features, doesn\\'t play well with a lot of non-adobe apps, no duplicate finder, slow-ish.\\n\\n-[PhotoMechanic Plus](https://home.camerabits.com/) (PM): Excellent cataloging, okay culling and import. Quite expensive, doesn\\'t let you assign custom keyboard shortcuts, weird-ish licensing system, hard to tell what data you have in your RAW photos (can you save under/overexposed parts? will it look good in B&W?) Update: they are currently adobe-fying their business model, but informed me personally that no actual software updates are planned. IMHO this is no longer a future-proof options, but we\\'ll see!\\n\\n-[ACDSee 10 for Mac](https://www.acdsee.com/en/products/photo-studio-mac/): Eh? Seems to work well, but has some... quirks. Always shows both jpeg and raw when shooting linked. Feels underdeveloped still, or like a paid version of Darktable.\\n\\n-[NeoFinder 8](https://cdfinder.de/index.html): Fast, stable, and well reviewed! Appears to lack any importing feature, but does have a lot else — even a mobile app! I also can\\'t find a way to assign custom keystrokes, and the duplicate detection is basically just DupeGuru but worse. There\\'s a lot of potential here, but I\\'m not yet convinced...\\n\\n-[FastRawViewer](https://www.fastrawviewer.com/): Amazing for culling, shows full RAW data and lets you view with basic \"effects\" like shadow boost of B&W. Lacks keywords or any kind of cataloguing or importing. Excellent RAW support, none for video or HEIC.\\n\\n-[XnViewMP](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/): Previews seem fast enough, but software seems slow and sometimes has issues when scrolling past videos. Unsure how usable it is for importing.\\n\\n-[Mylio](https://mylio.com/): Offers a lot of features and a nice UI for free, but also seems oversimplified, has a lot of weird restrictions, doesn\\'t offer a good way to switch to my backup drive if my main fails, and seems to read the wrong capture date on many of my Panasonic RAW photos. The terms and conditions and whether it will remain free are also concerns.\\n\\n-[PhotoSupreme](https://www.idimager.com/): Supposedly similar to PhotoMechanic?  I could not get it to work very well, seems to lack the import to year/month folder feature so I didn\\'t spend a ton of time with it. Fair warning: their website is really resource intensive; so make sure to close the tab!\\n\\n-[DigiKam](https://www.digikam.org/)\\\\*: I want to love it, but inevitably it stabs me in the back. Last time I used it, the software ran poorly, but upon installing 8.2.0, it\\'s as snappy as I could want... for browsing. Even after a very complex setup and days of cataloging, many of the features just aren\\'t working. Importing especially seems remarkably slow for reasons I can\\'t begin to guess.\\n\\n-[PhotoStructure](https://photostructure.com/)\\\\*: I\\'m hopeful? Seems to just be for cataloging and deleting duplicates, but paired with FastRawViewer and C1, I\\'m okay with that. Where I have issue, however, is that you seemingly can\\'t view all of your pictures in a timeline. Like Apple photos on the iPhone if you select \"Months\" instead of \"All photos,\" it only shows a sample from each date.\\n\\n-Adobe Bridge and similar DAMs without cataloging: Too slow and complex to navigate for more than like 20 pictures. At least FastRawViewer lets you efficiently see subfolder contents, unlike many of these. Great if you do low-batch work, but I shoot a lot (concerts, etc) so it\\'s a non-starter.\\n\\n-Network DAMs, ie Daminion: Sounds great. Doesn\\'t work for me per above...\\n\\n* [On1](https://www.on1.com/): I still need to try the current version. Last I used it though, it was no better than C1 for large catalogs, and marginally worse for ingest.\\n\\n-[Eagle](https://en.eagle.cool/): Looks fantastic! Will it deliver? Is it cost effective? Stay tuned...\\n\\n-[Tonfotos](https://tonfotos.com/): Think Mylio x PhotoStructure. Non-professional features are fantastic, but professional features are basically non-existent to date.\\n\\n-[Excire Foto](https://excire.com/): Seems great, especially if you want AI culling/sorting! No support for video though.\\n\\n-[ImageRanger](https://imageranger.com/tour): Looks like it\\'s in the middle of NeoFinder and Excire Foto in terms of features. I\\'ve used it a little bit, and it\\'s quick and useful, but lacks tags - a feature I need right now. It also hasn\\'t been updated since December 2023, which is concerning.\\n\\n-[FotoStation](https://fotostation.com/product/fotostation-pro/): Looks like it does pretty much everything, but it’s not cheap! I can’t afford it so I haven’t tried it, but it looks like PhotoMechanic with a better UI and customization + limited editing features.\\n\\n-[OneFolder](https://onefolder.app/): Simple but free and open source viewer. Features are simple, currently doesn\\'t have RAW support. But I like it; the features are good so far. I\\'m using it to view my exported photos.\\n\\nThere\\'s got to be a good solution out there! If you have advice, comments, or just found this thread helpful, let everyone know below!\\n\\nThank ya!\\n\\nP.S. I\\'ll update the above as I learn more! Looks for \"\\\\*\" P.P.S. Please don’t waste anyone’s time saying that taking a lot of pictures makes someone a worse photographer. Thousands of the world’s best photographers have million + libraries. We’re all different, but a small library is neither superior nor inferior.. UPDATE: Now featured on PetaPixel! - http://petapixel.com/2016/08/16/psa-need-dress-shoot-wedding/\\n\\nI shot a wedding once with a buddy where there were other hired professionals doing what they do, such as videographer, musicians, co-ordinators... You get the idea. My buddy and I work in such a way as to not get into each other\\'s shots, but should it be unavoidable, then we both wear formal, and could easily blend in as guests.\\n\\nThe problem with this one event was that a videographer was wearing a bright red casual t-shirt with cream chinos! He was a really nice guy though, and we chatted at length about our respective work. As there were two of us photographing the ceremony, we found it difficult to get a few specific angles, because in the background there was a red distraction in the frame, so alternative measures had to be taken (hiding him behind the registrar in the frame, for example). This should never need to be the case.\\n\\nI know that during these events things can get a bit restrictive if you\\'re wearing formal attire (especially in this weather!), but this is the nature of the job really, and for a formal event you would expect formal clothing. After all, you are selling not only your work, but yourself to potential future clients.\\n\\nSo that\\'s my little life pro tip! If you\\'re shooting a job where you are likely to be in another photo/videographer\\'s frame during the event, then just make sure to wear suitable clothing for that event so that you blend in, rather than stand out :)\\n. I have an iPhone 16 pro and have started taking pictures of art to upload to a teaching platform.\\n\\nUploading these photos results in a very underexposed and desaturated image. I\\'m seeing online that this may be a known issue, identified as iPhones shooting in Display P3, with websites automatically assigning the photo to the sRGB IEC61966-2.1 color profile before upload. The limitation of the website I\\'m using is that I can only upload in JPG and a file size smaller than 8.4mb.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried to bypass the issue in multiple ways below, but the end result is never quite right:\\n\\n1. Shooting in HEIC, converting to JPG and assigning sRGB IEC61966-2.1 in Preview\\n   * Strangely, this will produce an image that is not dim/desaturated SOMETIMES, but detail is lost. Typically, it will underexpose/desaturate just like uploading to a website without manually changing the profile\\n2. Shooting in HEIC,\\xa0**converting**\\xa0to sRGB IEC61966-2.1 color profile, color correcting, and exporting in JPG from Affinity Photo\\n   * This process is closest to achieving the desired image, but the color profile conversion process seems to washout details of the image I can\\'t regain, regardless of what I do with contrast, exposure, clarity, or vibrance. I\\'m photographing watercolor paper which has a lot of fine texture and variations of whites.\\n3. Shooting in JPG, assigning sRGB IEC61966-2.1 in Preview\\n   * Same issue as 1\\n4. Shooting in JPG, converting to sRGB IEC61966-2.1 color profile, color correcting\\n   * Same issue as 2\\n5. Shooting in RAW, converting to sRGB IEC61966-2.1 color profile, color correcting, and exporting in JPG from Affinity Photo\\n   * Same issue as 2\\n\\nI\\'ve confirmed that Affinity\\'s default color profile is sRGB IEC61966-2.1, that it does not convert immediately upon opening the file (so I have control), and Black Point compensation is checked. I\\'ve confirmed on my Mac that True Tone and Automatically adjust brightness are turned off as I\\'m editing (although even with these on, there is still an obvious difference between an un-retouched HEIC file and a file with an sRGB color profile).\\n\\nIs there a way to bypass all the photo editing, because the image looks pretty much perfect/ready to post after I shoot the image on my iPhone? Or do I just need to get better at Affinity/manual post-processing?\\n\\nThanks for reading.. I just got my auto renewal notice. It’s $120 a year.\\n\\nI haven’t use SmugMug in probably a decade. I’ve always let it renew because they are hosting 300-400 of my curated photos. The renewal also used to be cheaper.\\n\\nThose photos are also on Flickr. My Flickr page is more of a jumble. They aren’t really curated very well. On Flickr I would just do a big photo dump. So for example, the photos are there, but I would have to poke around to find the ones that I really liked. The ones I put on SmugMug were the ones that I like the best. But it has been at least a decade since I updated it - once I started using the iPhone I’d really didn’t go back to the hobby. \\n\\nDo you keep your photos in a couple of different spots?  Would you let this go? Or would you save it just in case you pick it back up again.  \\n\\nIf I tell them I want to cancel do I have to proactively go after my own photos or do they send them to me or do they merely delete them?\\n\\nThank you . Hi all,\\n\\nI have an iPhone 16 pro and have enjoyed playing with the various photography and camera control settings. \\n\\nOne thing I can’t figure out is why, no matter what “depth” setting I use (f-stop in camera control) the resulting photo shows f1.78 in the photo data - e.g. when swiping up on the photo in the photo album. \\n\\nIs that just how it works, in that the f-stop Apple lets you change using camera control is just a software setting and is not physically changing the aperture? \\n\\nI find it kind of annoying because if I like a particular shot and want to see the aperture setting for future reference, it always shows f1.78.\\n\\nI’ve tried Googling this and reading a lot of Reddit posts but haven’t seen anything that explains it. . Hi there,\\n\\nI wanted to make progress from taking pictures with my iPhone 14. In case of travel and low light.\\n\\nAfter a lot of research I decided to buy the Sony A6400. Due to various reasons. I wanted to stay under the 1000€ (I’m from Germany) mark. Full frame is a lot bigger and heavier, so I guessed it would be harder for travel like airport weight and so on. And a lot of forums and articles said the Sony a6400 is a top Apsc under 1000€ still even if it’s now 5 years since its release.\\n\\nSo I was quite hyped when I ordered one. I bought the version with the sel1650 (E PZ 16-50mm F3.5-5.6 OSS) kit lens because I wanted to test the camera a bit to see which focal length I like to buy new glass for. \\n\\nI also have to say that although I have now experience with such cameras I read a lot beforehand and I have an engineering background so I understand the concept of the exposure triangle.\\n\\nI tested the camera the first time outside in the park at around 9:30 pm so just after sunset. I was expecting better “light sensitivity” than with my iPhone 14. So I took the same pictures with each. Then I looked in the specs of the pictures respectively. On the Sony a6400 I shot with auto mode, and aperture priority (set to almost the smallest value, biggest opening with a bit zoom that is easy just f5.6) there where iso values up to 6400, the I phone was a lot under 1000. The exposure time was higher than on the iPhone. Well the iPhone seems to have f1.6, so that is much much bigger. But I thought the apsc sensor is so much bigger than the iPhone one that it would be better. \\n\\nWhat is my problem? Definitely my skill is an issue, that’s for sure. But do I need new glass even to beat my iPhone? Because I expect the Sony to outperform my smartphone in case of sharpness, contrast, low light and so on. Why is it so bad? \\n\\nAnd if I buy new glass would it be worth it to buy lenses without OSS? Because the a6400 doesn’t have a built in stabilizer.\\n\\nThank you! :). Hi yall! So I am well aware I will not be able to get insane photos with just my iPhone camera. However when I use my iPhone 16 pro camera set up on a tripod, it will give me 30 second exposures that turn out pretty good. I can almost make out some small details (very faint) of M42 nebula.\\n\\nMy question is on the fact that I normally use the standard iPhone camera which gives me 48 megapixels on 30 second exposures.\\n\\nIf for fun I wanted to see just how much detail I could squeeze out on M42 would I be better off using the 5x optical zoom camera that is also on the back with long exposure even if it is only 12 megapixels?\\n\\nBasically standard at 48 mp or 12 mp at 5x optical (both will be long exposures and I will likely stack several)\\n\\nThanks!. Hi everyone!\\nAfter switching from an iPhone 11 to an iPhone 14 Pro, I noticed that it takes absolutely terrible photos of the night sky in long exposure mode. Every time I try to point the camera at the sky, it automatically switches to macro mode. As a result, all the images are completely blurry. The iPhone 11’s camera wasn’t the best, but it didn’t have this issue. You could focus to infinity with just one tap.\\n\\nQuestion 1: Do iPhone 15 and 16 Pro users experience the same problem?\\n\\nQuestion 2: Apple, are you planning to fix this?. I\\'m an ametuer to photography world. I know that DSLR cameras physically alter the aperture of the lens to allow or disallow light and alter depth of field as well.\\n\\niPhone 16 camera configuration for 3 cameras are 24mm f/1.78, 13mm f/2.2 and 120mm f/2.8.\\n\\nThey say the iPhones don\\'t have variable aperture function so the aperture won\\'t phyically open or close.\\n\\nSo I assume iPhone camera have fixed apertures - 1.78, 2.2 and 2.8. I believe with these apertures you would get shallow depth of field by default.\\n\\nMy question is how come iPhones take F8 pictures as the camera itself can\\'t provide long depth of field because the apertures are fixed to max 2.8? I would like to know computationally how it does that.. There has been crazy AI updates with the new Pixel 8 Pro and it has now manual controls, something which was lacking till 7 Pro series. I have been using the Pixel series phone since 2018 and they have got some great developments. At least I can vouch for the image quality which is still better than iphone. Would love to hear your thoughts on the same?. Okay so this is sort of like a rant / PSA.\\n\\nBack up your stuff, peeps! My hard drive on a less-than-a-year-old laptop failed. As a student this is sort of a big hit. About 900GB of data gone. Only about 250GB were backed up. On 8/16/2013 (I purchased my laptop 8/16/2012 I was going to give my laptop a fresh 128GB SSD and a 2TB external drive to store all my photos / data. Wasn\\'t expecting my hard drive to fail less than a year in. But they *do* fail so back up your stuff now!  \\n\\nI\\'m not a professional photographer. So I guess I\\'m thankful that I\\'m only losing photos and not clients on top of money or whatever compensation that I\\'d have to provide for them. \\n\\nMy drive was partitioned so that I had about 300GB on my C drive and my D drive was all neat (with school stuff too). On the D drive there were some 200GB in photos and another 300GB or so of video work that I\\'ve done... that\\'s photos with my girlfriend, freshman year, fun times, etc. Photos that I want to recover but am really, really considering if I can afford the data recovery (they\\'re more expensive than I thought) as an undergrad. \\n\\nWhat\\'s pissing me off the most I guess is that there were some 5000 photos of a timelapse project that I was working on. Ka-put! I thought I had backed this up to my external HDD but apparently not. \\n\\nSome of these photos are up on Facebook but more\\'s on my hard drive than not online. \\n\\nSo folks, back up your data **today.** Don\\'t wait! I thought it would be okay to wait since my drive was less than a year old, but damn, I\\'m stumped now. I know people are going to say, \"Oh why didn\\'t you do this earlier, blah blah\" but I spent most of my $$$s on the laptop and camera gear. \\n\\nCheers and hope this doesn\\'t happen to you. \\n\\nPS: Anyone know of any cheap data recovery centres located in Korea? \\n\\n**EDIT:** Thanks for all the support! Looks like the PSA got around to a lot of you. :) Better back up today rather than be sorry like myself! D: < I\\'m going to try out some of the recovery solutions that you guys have mentioned and will update on this thread whether I get back my data or not. . I am getting into photography tho I don’t know much about it. I’ve started using my phone for long exposure and or using the ultra wide as I liked taking details but started noticing that the iPhone does almost everything automatically relative to the environment like the iso and maybe shutter speed? Idk if iPhone has shutter speed but I tried light room but the photos I take wont upload to my phone and I’m guessing it is due to the fact it uploads it to a cloud and you are supposed to download it from there so I a sense I’m gate keeped from that but I cannot find any other apps that are for free that let me control the following \\n\\nShutter speed \\nISO \\nFocus \\nExposure \\nDuration of the long exposure \\nAnd or a conjunction of all of these like lowering the exposure and iso to take better long exposure photography \\n\\nI want to ask if there is maybe a free app that helps me do this or if I’m using Lightroom wrong and the camera is free\\n\\nUpdate: \\nI’m very very dumb, in adobe lighting I had it on edit only for the showing in the edits section but I didn’t know you could change it to unedited which was the way to show the images and nowhere does it tell me but it’s intuitive. Also found a video app dazz cam and it allows me to mess with iso and shutter speeds as well which is neat. Thank you everyone who commented . Hopefully you all [got to know each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/6zoca2/community_thread_introductions/) already, so let\\'s get this moving.\\n\\nWhat are you up? \\n\\nWhat\\'s your latest gadget? \\n\\netc. . Hello lovely people! Obligatory new account since I didn\\'t want to dox my main account. Anyway, here\\'s the scoop:\\n\\nI ordered a camera bag from https://sunny16.com/. Another IG ad got me. It is my responsibility to do my due diligence to verify products before buying them.\\xa0 **BIG NOTE: This is not about Sunny16Labs which from what I can tell is a reputable lab.** I haven’t seen any Reddit posts about Sunny16, and if they exist, they aren’t showing up in searches. I also haven\\'t seen many \\\\*real\\\\* reviews come up on a quick Google search. All the recent Instagram posts from Sunny16, have no comments, making it difficult to find genuine customer experiences. It seems they go out of their way to respond quickly to any comments about order issues, creating an illusion of good customer support. They also delete negative comments telling people not to buy. I know this because they deleted mine. They even deleted my comment requesting help and not even warning people not to buy. This is also true of their founder’s account, Shant Kiraz (@shantkiraz), when doing shared posts with the Sunny16 account. However, behind closed doors, they ghost.\\n\\nI dealt with an issue with their customer support, which is the most unresponsive I\\'ve ever encountered. This is not just a complaint about my specific experience. It\\'s a warning that this brand is not to be trusted, and in my opinion, borders on scam. And I have receipts to prove it (https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/6oc3n6gkcbx7nurggaoee/AGdE70TAraANfVcmyQWb-Dk?rlkey=us3ps6wua3dsq56kiq1bgmmly&st=c58qmeom&dl=0). I want to give the community the knowledge to not fall for this company’s scummy marketing and business practices.\\n\\nHere’s my experience:\\n\\nI ordered the bag on April 17th. When I ordered, it was in stock (no screenshots here, but I could order, so clearly, it was in stock). I waited for two weeks and hadn’t received any tracking info. I then reached out to their support email to get an update. Two weeks later, there was no response. I followed up on the email with no response again for a few days when I saw a collaborative post (ad) for the bag with Shant Kiraz and Sunny16. I commented on the ad with a polite request about my shipping issue, noting that I have already tried to reach out via email. You might call me naive for this, but when nothing serious is on the line, I like to give it the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, Shant immediately reached out to my DMs asking for an order # to try and help me. To me, this was a great showing…at first. I thought, “Wow, the company founder reached out to help? They might be having an issue with their support email right now. This is actually promising.” This immediately turned to disappointment and realization that this was a scummy business when he didn’t respond further until over 24 hours later with not 1, but 2 follow-up DMs from me. While Shant wasn’t responding, I also DM’d the Sunny16 account, repeating the issue I was facing. They took about 11 hours to respond and actually responded at about the same time as Shant.\\n\\nThis is where it gets interesting. They both told me the color I ordered was out of stock and was currently being restocked. Strange, because it was in stock when I ordered it. They clearly have no communication with “their\" warehouse. A clear indication of a dropshipping business to me. Nothing necessarily wrong with this, but it can be annoying to deal with. They both reported that my options were to wait for the color I wanted or select an in-stock color. All fine, but I didn’t want a different color or to wait for another who knows how long for my order to ship so I requested to cancel. I ended up sending my cancellation request to both DMs and their email. The email never responded (expected), Shant also never responded. The Sunny16 account responded, albeit after another day\\'s wait and multiple follow-ups. Unfortunately, they didn’t respond with the cancellation information. They responded with a message stating that my order was marked as “priority” and would ship soon. I thought it was out of stock… I then reiterated that this was not what I wanted and wanted to cancel. They did not respond. I followed up once. Then, 3 days later, I got shipping info, and the tracking said it left the warehouse the same day. This shows that they do have stock but don’t want to ship it unless you bug and fight them about it for long enough. On top of that, they also will do anything to keep your money, including completely disregarding what you, the customer, want.\\n\\nThe bag arrives today, but I am not optimistic about it. According to this ThePhoblographer review(https://www.thephoblographer.com/2021/09/02/this-bag-has-a-big-flaw-sunny-16-voyager-camera-bag-review/), which I found later, the quality is okay, but I have some other evidence that makes me question this, as the review is relatively old at this point. I will update with full quality review once I have used the bag for some time.\\n\\nI also reached out to a few people who commented on Sunny16 posts with order issues to see what their experience was like and got similar stories. Only one person responded to me, but what they shared was very telling. Screenshots of our convo (with the other user redacted per their request) are attached in the dropbox above.\\n\\nTLDR: Sunny16 the gear brand is a “scam” in my opinion. Don’t buy from them. (Maybe even report them?). I’m planning on taking some pictures to update my portfolio. Now i’m wondering if it really matters that much who I go with. I feel like a random friend with an iPhone wouldn’t be as good as an actual professional photographer obviously. Should I do some research on photographers in the area that could make me look as good as possible or is there really no reason to as long as they have good equipment?\\n\\nEdit : A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding what i’m actually asking. What i actually meant was if any academically trained/professional photographer would be as good as the next to take some pictures for my modelling portfolio. Meaning can I just pick the first one that seems decent or should I spend considerable time figuring out who is the absolute best in the area because the difference would be that big if i didn’t. This doesn’t mean that i’m asking if some people can take better pictures than others and if you could just give an expensive camera to any layman and get amazing results whatever the skill level is.. Never say FINAL:\\n\\nI found if the ambient light level is close to the LED\\'s, the color shows. If there is too much ambient the color is washed out, and if there is too little the sensors seem to get confused. I was able to get decent results at dusk with the right framing. It was funny watching the LEDs turn more white as night rolled in.\\n\\n\\n\\nFINAL EDIT:\\n\\nHere is a proof image of what is happening: [Color LED Problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/photographs/comments/1ds1y2w/color_led_image_problem_proof_the_color_leds_on/)\\n\\nIt seems the industry may have a problem.\\n\\nEDIT: It Gets Better\\n\\nSo, it seems exposure is NOT the issue. I suspect the issue is due to the nature of the light generated by the LEDs. Even though LEDs are classified as incoherent light sources, the method of light generation appears to be more coherent than not.\\n\\nI say that based on the observations of the included images from a Nikon Z9 with a 105 2.8S Macro lens (except for the iPhone capture). Please see new post with pix (can\\'t add them here).\\n\\nThe LEDs are white on both cameras, actually. The iPhone seems to enhance the scatter when the light hits a surface. But both cameras see the color only after the light hits something.\\n\\nSee new post. [Color LEDs](https://www.reddit.com/r/photographs/comments/1drl8nt/color_led_problem_middle_led_is_a_hot_pink_square/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\\n\\nThe center LED is HOT PINK to the eye, but it is white to the camera. The pink comes from the scattered light on the tape and background.\\n\\nI tried adjusting the exposure last night, and it looks like I may be able to get enough color by stacking. But High Color LEDs definitely mess with camera image processors, at least Nikon and Apple.\\n\\nHi, all.\\n\\nI found an odd thing when taking pictures of our yard that included a few Philips Hue bollards. They are 16-million-color things, not just RGB. Anyway, my Nikon Z7 hardly \\'sees\\' the colors and the bollards\\' light is almost white. It isn\\'t just the view; pics are also of white light (slightly tinted).\\n\\nAs a test, I took the same basic shots with my iPhone 15, and the colors are there (but still not as vibrant as they appear to the eye).\\n\\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this?\\n\\nThanks, all.. EDIT 6-19, 8:30am PST: thank you to everyone who has offered suggestions and advice. I can’t figure out how to turn off commenting, but I am all set at this point. Please use your wisdom to help others! I won’t know any more until I start processing my photos which will take a while. Thanks so much! \\n\\nJust got back from Tanzania where I brought my Sony A6000 with the kit 16-55 lens and a rented 70-350 Sony lens which I used for almost all of my photos. I had a really hard time getting it to focus while I was there, especially at a distance, which I wasn\\'t expecting. I tried to use sport mode and some other tricks to get it to focus but...looking through a random sampling of my photos and they are ALL BLURRY. I thought I\\'d get 100-200 decent ones, but so many of them have nothing in the frame in focus. Not even the wrong thing in focus, just NOTHING in focus. I\\'m beyond frustrated and angry. This was a trip of a lifetime and all the great shots I took don\\'t seem usable.\\n\\nIs there any way to salvage any of them? I have Lightroom and Photoshop, and for the right frame I\\'d be willing to put in the work, but I\\'m just so discouraged that they\\'re all ruined. Here\\'s a selection: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/91696710@N07/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/91696710@N07/)\\n\\nReally trying not to just delete the whole SD card because I really wanted some of these to put up in my house and I\\'m not sure what to do at this point. Thanks.\\n\\nUpdate: I found one really great photo of a warthog which I added on flickr if anyone wants to see what I was expecting my photos to look like versus the rest of the ones I uploaded.. Any ideas on how to do this? I’ll be shooting photos and videos of an event and the client wants real time photos to display on a tv screen. My only thought is using my iPhone for those, but just wanted to see if there’s any other way to do this?\\n\\nIt’ll just be me so I won’t have an additional person who can do some quick edits or anything. \\n\\nEdit: Shooting with a Canon R6ii\\n\\nMore details: it’s a four hour nature hike event.. there’s a new hike starting every 45 minutes so people will be coming in and out. They want general event photos and a 90-second recap video.. I’ve been loyal customer of C1 for 4 years and I faced their total ignorance and incompetence. \\nFew days ago I updated my Mac iOS system and apparently my capture one stoped work ( no exporting files, system quit unexpectedly). So I decided to contact customer support. No reply for few days, only some bot automatic messages. I went into my C1 profile and I saw there if a version higher than the one I have and I’m eligible to download it, version 16.3, so I try to activate it and there is no luck. Customer support wrote to me, that information in my profile wrong and the product I bough they pushed the version that I eligible to have is 16.2 now, lol ok… but this version is incapable to work with new iOS as well, never mind I’m already angry and demand support to reply to me. So today they send me email they made mistake again, now my eligible version is 16.1, so do you see how it keep decreasing every day I try to contact their support. \\nSo there is no answer to that again. I have all screenshots of their emails and how they keep decreasing the version I’m allowed to have every day, so I have all of this in my pocket, from their side there is nothing. I’m working photographer and for so many days I can’t use C1 properly. Good that I have adobe which never do this shit to their customers and I can use photoshop and Lightroom to export my files. \\nLast thing why do they even sell perpetual license, which you can use “as long as you want” without update the app, of these license only work for a year. In this case it’s make more sense just to buy monthly subscription, because these perpetual license are total scam and they push you to buy it every year now!  \\nI never been more disappointed. \\nWho has same feeling, photographers how are you?. Last month, iPhone 15 line up had been released. Especially for iPhone 15 Pro Max, it came with 5x optical zoom using tetra-prism setup which would be similar to periscope lens on S23 Ultra. However, when I tried them at the store, the image quality at the tele range is not very impressive especially in low light. The noise/de-noising is too much. Looking at the specs the Pro Max line up have the following\\n\\n* Main\\n   * 48 MP 1/1.28\" (10 x 7.5 mm), crop factor of 3.46\\n   * 24 mm f/1.78\\n   * True focal length 6.94 mm\\n   * DoF equivalent f/6.15\\n* Wide\\n   * 12 MP 1/2.55\" (5.6 x 4.2 mm), crop factor of 6.19\\n   * 13 mm f/2.2\\n   * True focal length 2.10 mm\\n   * DoF equivalent f/13.62\\n* Tele\\n   * 12 MP 1/3.5\" (4.5 x 3 mm), crop factor of 8\\n   * 120mm f/2.8\\n   * True focal length 15 mm\\n   * DoF equivalent f/22.4\\n\\nIt make sense that for tele, it need to have smaller image sensor to reduce the focal length. But this also decrease amount of light the sensor can capture. Thus, the noise is increased. So in low light, to have any usable telephoto, heavy noise filtering is applied. This caused a lot of detail to be lost\\n\\nLast year, [LG innotek teased 4x - 9x optical zoom](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/zwu3nf/lg_innotek_reveals_the_optical_telephoto_zoom/). But it is likely a trade off between continuous focal range, and aperture, and I do expected smaller on 9x end. Assume best case, where we use the same camera lens specs of [Sony RX100 VII](https://www.dpreview.com/products/sony/compacts/sony_dscrx100m7) of 24-200 mm f/2.8 - 4.5 then we will lose the light about 1.33 stop. So either they make the sensor area larger by 2.5 times, or they need to better design their lens\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at [S23 Ultra camera telephoto](https://youtu.be/CPlisjZ8CNw?si=M6R6RTDjZ_yCX4pR&t=145) setup. They have 3x f/2.4 (69 mm), and 10x zoom f/4.9 (230 mm). They did this to combat the aperture problem by using prime lens. But anywhere in between 3x, and 10x it will be a digital crop of 3x sensor. So at 9x zoom, your image is probably look like garbage before snap back to acceptable image at 10x\\n\\nSony IMX989 (crop factor of 2.72) seems to becoming more common on flagship phone. So if it were to be applied to telephoto of 200mm equivalent, the focal range would need to be 73.5 mm or about 7.4 cm. That is about the whole width of a smartphone\\n\\nBut since the smartphone chassis space is at a premium, they probably can\\'t realistically have better low light performance with the small compact camera design. The most camera on a smartphone is 16 (by Light L16 Phone). But that one is non-practical anyway, and they can\\'t just keep adding camera. So what they can do to improve the telephoto performance on a smartphone?\\n\\nI have a few ideas that came to mind\\n\\n* [Xaomi 12S Ultra Concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_2hSsibj-E), which just expose their main camera with a lens mount. Basically convert it to a mirrorless camera\\n   * This is similar to [Beastgrip DoF Adapter](https://beastgrip.com/pages/beastgrip-dof-depth-of-field-adapter-user-manual), which allow you to mount traditional mount on to the case (manual focus only, based on EF mount, but can mount Nikon F, and G mount using adapter ring). The DoF mk2 seems to [loose light around 20%](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/lit_files/619695.pdf), so about 1/3 stop (not bad). But the rig is very large and bulky, because they are based on full-frame lens (but you do what you gonna do)\\n* Third party lens, [Moment lens](https://www.shopmoment.com/products/tele-58mm-lens-t-series/tele-t-series) is a good example of this. They have 58 mm tele converter zoom over original 24 mm main camera. So it might be possible to engineer a zoom lens version for this. But I would not imagine the lens size\\n* [Minolta RD-3000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMvKfSBQEUk) has a dual chip sensor by splitting the image into 2 parts at 90 degree angle. This has the potential to have a larger sensor in a small enclosure. But it won\\'t solve the focal length issue\\n\\nOr maybe smartphone camera is reaching its limit, smartphone camera is meant to just take a photo, and not think about it. I mean I still prefer image from my DSLR camera any day of the week. So if the smartphone photo is worse, you just shouldn\\'t care. And if I want a better quality photo, I\\'ve should\\'ve just buy a small compact, or mirrorless camera that you can carry anywhere and use them in companion to a smartphone anyway. There was something like this in 2014 of [Sony QX series](https://www.sony.co.th/en/electronics/support/compact-cameras-dsc-qx-series/manuals), but since been discontinued. A recent version of this is [Alice camera](https://www.alice.camera/) which is micro four-third sensor, and lens mount (12 MP, pixel size 4.65 um - i.e. good in low light). This time, it have a proper mount too. Hi there, amateur photographer here, planning a two week self-drive vacation through Scotland in the spring. We\\'ll alternate driving every other day, with a full day and 2 nights at each stop. Hopefully that will give us enough time to take some decent photos at each point along the route. \\n\\nI hope to take street photos and architecture in Edinburgh and in the other towns, and landscape everywhere else. Oh, and I\\'m \\\\*hoping\\\\* to try my hand at some night landscape/astro shots if possible.\\n\\nI\\'m tempted to bring all my shit with me, but I know better, so I deliberately bought a small camera bag that won\\'t hold it all. Now I just need to decide what to leave behind. I\\'d like advice on that please.\\n\\nCamera: Nikon D5300 (APSC/DX)\\n\\nLenses:\\n\\n* Nikon 35mm f/1.8 G AF-S DX (maybe for street)\\n* Tamron 90mm f/2.8 Di SP AF/MF (happens to be a 1:1 Macro Lens, but not planning for much macro)\\n* Nikon 18-200mm F/3.5-5.6 G ED VR AF-S DX \\n* Nikon 18-70mm f/3.5-4.5 G IF-ED AF-S DX \\n* Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8 AT-X116 Pro DX II\\n\\nIdeally I\\'d like to bring only two of the above, but I\\'m having trouble getting below three.\\n\\nThe obvious decision is to bring only one of the 18-\\\\* zooms. I\\'m leaning towards bringing the smaller one because most of my travel shots seem to not go much beyond 135mm.\\n\\nReally tempted to bring the ultrawide zoom because of the landscape opportunities. Also possible astro.\\n\\nAlso tempted to bring the Tamron tele because it\\'s bright and sharp, but I feel like I\\'m being impractical with that.\\n\\nThe 35 seems like a no-brainer because its small.\\n\\nAdvice is welcome, thanks!\\n\\n\\nUpdate: thanks all for the great advice and feedback. \\n\\nI\\'ve decided to go with:\\n- 18-200\\n- 35\\n- 11-16 (just in case)\\n\\nCheers! . Hello,\\n\\nMy wife\\'s father recently passed-away and I was given his entire camera collection.  This includes several Leica film bodies as well as a bunch of Leica glass.\\n\\n\\nI have been shooting SLR photography for about 10-years now, but only digital.  I have little film experience.  I have only a few days to choose a couple of pieces to bring back with me (I don\\'t want to bring everything at this point), so I ask for some advice on the best body and lens combo for a total novice film guy.\\n\\nThe bodies to choose from are:\\n\\n* M1\\n\\n* M4-2\\n\\n* M5\\n\\n* D.R.P.

They are unable to continue to provide 1 year of goodwill updates for perpetual as it is unsustainable. This is literally all they are saying.

If there is a major bug present in, for example 17.1.0 that is only fixed in 17.2.0, Does this mean users will need to purchase a new Capture One Perpetual license just for the bug fix?

I understand WD Backup isn\\'t great so need to figure out a good and easy backup software (any suggestions). Then since I am Prime, was going to use Amazon Photos for my offsite/cloud location; might pay for extra cloud storage for videos, but that\\'s TBD for now. This will satisfy the 3-2-1 advice. And I would hope that WD and Amazon Photos cloud storage would be simple enough to navigate to recover any lost files on the primary SanDisk storage in the laptop, should that happen\\n\\nFor organization and photo viewing, I like Picasa because I am familiar with it, and I\\'ve already created some \"favorites\" folders that I\\'d rather not have to recreate. I suppose I can continue using Picasa with this setup as long as it points to the SanDisk drive which I just leave in the laptop, but at some point I know it will be gone for good (next laptop update?). Any good alternatives I should consider with a bit more permanence? Should I instead just use whatever viewer/editor Amazon Photos has and make the cloud my primary storage and just have the WD and SanDisc drives as backup?\\n\\nIs there a good way to automate getting photos off my phone onto the laptop and/or Amazon Photos besides PhotoSync? I tend to have to do it manually every now and then since for some reason the \"triggers\" don\\'t activate and push the photos from the phone to the laptop automatically.\\n\\nAppreciate any thoughts...know there\\'s a lot here...\\n\\n&#x200B;. I discovered this post yesterday: [iPhone 13 Pro: The Edge of Intelligent Photography](https://lux.camera/iphone-13-pro-camera-app-intelligent-photography/). It offered a very good, detailed analysis of what computational photography in these new phone systems is actually doing. Just look at the examples of the actual raw images, versus, say, the \"pro raw\" you get from these systems. I was surprised to see how much processing is already done for even a basic \"raw\" photo on a phone.\\n\\nSo, the software being used on these systems is what\\'s really making the changes these days. And each version of a software package seems to change the game.\\n\\nThis is what\\'s bothered me, as a hobbyist. With my camera (a Nikon D7000), I\\'m gaining an _intuition_, because ultimately, it hasn\\'t changed in a decade. But even changing from an iPhone 11 to an iPhone 13 feels so different. Because, well, it is. So, I\\'m left with a sense of \"fighing my phone\", like, having to zoom in on every damn image I take to verify that the phone is doing something I want.\\n\\nAnd as a professional software engineer, I fully understand that change is going to be happening _constantly_, because that\\'s just the pure nature of software. So, the image you take, _on the same device_, might change over the course of the same hardware, since a system update may change algorithms.\\n\\nMy sense is that this has uncovered _why_ I don\\'t like computational photography; I don\\'t feel like I can spend enough time to learn how to control it, and it\\'s always changing. But that leads me to a few questions, and I\\'m curious what others think:\\n\\n1. Would you only want ISO/Aperture/Shutter Speed controls, or would you want something else?\\n2. What kinds of software controls make sense to you?\\n3. Are there apps today that give you a feel of control?. I purchased a cheap 16\" x 16\" x 16\" lightbox. I am using my iPhone to take pictures of objects for a small online business. I would love to get a background that is jet black, and absorbs light vantablack style, but would prefer not to make it myself. Any recommendations?. Second update:\\nShe has provided the digital negatives! Hurrah! Claimed an error with some software and thanked me for pointing it out. \\n\\nThank you all for your supportive comments. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUpdate: I appreciate everyone\\'s comments and I feel a whole lot better about it. I have asked for the \"the originals/negatives/larger sized/high resolution photos\" - knowing the ones we already have might be okay to print reasonably large, but I kind want what I was expecting to buy. \\n\\nUnfortunately,  this is the response: \"Hello [BC]\\n\\nThank you for explaining your way that things work in the UK. The way I sent the images is the way my business works. The images are all High resolution and in 300DPI these images can all be printed at 20x30. Which is the size of my 24 megapixel camera, I cannot provide bigger. So appreciate your email, please download your images before March 11th. \\xa0\\n\\nHave a good night\"\\n\\nI\\'m suprised her camera only produces 1mb-4mb sized files - she looked liked she had legit kit (think fuck off big camera, lenses, one of those even the light out canvases on a huge tripod). I think my wife\\'s iPhone takes larger res images. I think tbh she\\'s fobbing me off with a lie cause she doesn\\'t want to send me the originals. Can anyone more knowledgeable than me point out any bollocks in her reply?\\n\\nThank you again everyone!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirstly, a big thank you to anyone who takes the time to reply.\\n\\nMy mum organised a photoshoot over the Chrsitmas period. The photographer charged a fee for the shoot and then has a website where you can purchase more photos either as digital or prints.\\n\\nThe website (and the contract) don\\'t state the res of the photos.\\n\\nThe photos have come through and they are between 600kb and 3.5Mb. \\n\\nI\\'ve spoken with the photographer thinking this was a mistake. However, she\\'s stated this is normal and she only provides 8x10 sized photos and not the original resolution photos. \\n\\nIt\\'s made all the worse that my Dad is dying and these photos are likely to be some of the last before it all goes to shit. \\n\\nI just wanted some help, and maybe some guidance ideally from professional photographers in the US.\\n\\nThank you everyone!. My mom used to take alot pictures... and I hated it to be honest (teenager.. hating things is what we do). But when I was about 13 my grandparents gifted me an old completely manual camera made in GDR. It was work taking good pictures.. and man was it a learning curve.. which oddly enough I really enjoyed. Shooting pics with an all mechanical camera was quite rewarding when you got a good picture. \\n\\nLater on I bought a small digital camera and took alot of pictues .. most of which I unfortunately seemed to have lost. HDD´s die and back then I wasnt a good data hoarder (well, that has certainly changed).\\n\\nShooting some pictures was easy but it didnt feel as rewarding. So when I was about 16 I got myself a DSLR from Sony, 12 mp.. and man were the pictured so much better. (I only shot in jpeg though). Here my developement kinda stopped once I got myself an iPhone (3GS) and started taking most pictures with it.. it was lazy but worked just fine. For many years that was enough, I had other stuff on my mind. Studies, games... girlfriend... girlfriend turning into wife... then the mother of my child.\\n\\nNow I´m sitting here and thinking... these pictures I´m taking of my family... they look bad. Mobile phone cameras have come a long way.. my old DSLR takes kinda better pics still but not by very much but somehting always seems to be missing. I really want to be able to capture special and normal moments in a much deeper way.\\n\\n**I´ve realized that you can take good pictures with every camera.. but you cant take every picture well enough with just any camera.**\\n\\nSo now I have a Nikon Z7 coming.. with a Z 24-70 f4... and I´m already thinking about more lenses. Macro is cool gonna need a lens for that. Astrophotography is cool as well.. so is wide angle for Landscape as well as a zoom lens. Oh and some nice prime lens for portraits.\\n\\n... when does it stop?. Fellow photographers,\\n\\nWhile I think Adobe really messed up with the marketing of their triple announcement recently, I have to say, I\\'m quite impressed with a few things. But first, can we get something out of the way?\\n\\nIf Adobe just named their new version **\"Lightroom CC Mobile\"**, or something like that, and kept the existing Lightroom the same name or renamed it **\"Lightroom CC Pro\"** or something, I think a lot more people would be at ease. Instead they\\'ve upset and confused a lot of people for no reason.\\n\\nWith that out of the way, here\\'s something I\\'m super excited about!: **With a regular CC subscription, you can sync all your photos to the cloud as Smart Previews.** Here are some benefits:\\n\\n- Smart Previews are synced initially from Lightroom CC Classic to the cloud. It\\'s smart enough to only sync 1 image for JPG+RAW combos.\\n- These photos can be viewed in Lightroom CC on iPhone, iPad, Web ([Yes, Web!](https://lightroom.adobe.com)) or any other Lightroom instance including the new Lightroom CC for Desktop (The names are SO CONFUSING).\\n- The Smart Previews are lossy, and super small, and therefore do not have huge bandwidth costs. They are roughly 1-2MB each. They are only uploaded once from your main computer, and downloaded once on any additional device.\\n- The Smart Previews are decent enough quality to edit on an iPad, iPhone or even on my retina MacBook. Perfect enough for social media sharing.\\n- The best thing: **Smart Previews synced to your CC account do not count towards your storage limit!**\\n- After the initial upload/download, metadata for edits are uploaded/downloaded (synced) thereafter to all devices when you use them.\\n- Local EXIF sidecar files will be updated when your desktop instance is synced with the cloud edits. (This is important for me)\\n\\nI am STOKED about this.\\n\\nThe instructions to get this going are a little convoluted but found here: [Sync Lightroom Classic CC across desktop and mobile platforms](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/help/lightroom-mobile-desktop-features.html)\\n\\nI will never personally use Adobe to sync all my RAW photos using Lightroom (I use Google Drive for that), but this gives me so much more confidence in sticking with Lightroom. I can edit on the go, on any of my devices, while keeping my main RAW library local.\\n\\nHope this helps some of you fellow photographers.. I am fascinated by the incremental updates that smartphones, particularly iPhones, are bringing about to the photography and videography realms every year. Full frame cameras are now being challenged by the hdr that you can get strait out of the new iPhone 12s. And all I can think about is that every year ,the reasons for getting most consumer grade cameras will be less and less.  Humans have pretty small sensors if you think about it, but our hardware is very complex and coupled with some outstanding software.  I personally think that at some point phones will be able to make videos that are just as good as every consumer grade camera on the market. These cameras, inspite of their huge sensors, are paired with processors that simply can\\'t compete with the processors like the a14. Anyway, my big idea is that at some point, specific ultra wide angle lens will stop existing on smart phones, and in their place , two normal lens will be used to merge their field of view digitally to make for significantly better low light than what a GoPro could offer for example. I\\'m still guessing on how to replace glass to zoom in for videos, but I think you guys can see where this is going. Whose with me? Am I wrong? I just bought a Sony a7c and I it\\'s paired with a f/1.8 20 mm and while it still has better cinematic quality than my iPhone 12 pro, my iPhone 12 pro has better hdr. No questions asked. So yeah, let\\'s talk about.. I couldn\\'t believe it after updating the ios app. It is no more a place for professionals. It looks like the mainpurpose of it is to take crappy iphone/ipad pictures and upload it directly. If you want an app like instagram then get instagram but I don\\'t need another one. Generally the dark design was way better to concentrate on the pictures and overlooking. And why the hell they hide the used settings. This was for me the most interesting part and a good reason to use this app. But now I don\\'t see a reason to still use it. With that feature the community will be flooded with poor quality pictures taken with phones.. Weirdly enough, video came first with proper 10-bit HDR for consumers and been with us for.. almost a decade? From recording capability, editing, and monitor/TV for the end users. But I think only 4 years ago that we got final images in 10-bit (in HEIF, not JPEG, but also not in RAW) from Canon 1DX mk.III, and still isn\\'t widely spread among camera manufacturers.\\n\\nYes I know RAW files can capture 14, maybe 16-bit colours, that\\'s why we have so much leeway in the edit for 8-bit JPEG final images. But with 10-bit final product, and displayed on proper 10-bit monitor/TV, we could see images that are true to life in terms of tone/dynamic range (colour might be subjective in editing I think).\\n\\nI\\'m hopeful that it would be a, or _the_ standard for stills, especially after that latest Adobe Camera Raw update that can edit & export 10-bit HEIF images.. Hello Everyone,\\n\\n****UPDATE: 6/10/2016: State Farm claims called me to let me know that they are issuing a check for the entire amount that was claimed. This is incredible from their part. I will be looking for my check next week in the mail! I had bought all used gear but had them insured for new price. So, state farm cut a check for new price! *****\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Sunday, May 22nd, I had all my camera gear stolen from a Dodge Journey which I had rented while I was on vacation with my family near Bayside Marketplace.\\n\\nI had recently purchased my full-frame kit and all new lenses and this disaster happened.\\n\\nI would like to use this community to reach out to people or help with recovering my lost gear. I called some pawn shops but none have a camera on sale.\\n\\nThe serial numbers are as follows:\\n\\nCanon EOS 7D 2171102607\\n\\nCanon EOS 6D 42024011344\\n\\nCanon EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM 2601110382\\n\\nCanon 24mm TS-E f/3.5L 32920\\n\\nCanon 16-35mm f/4L IS USM 3720002422\\n\\nCanon 70-200mm f/4L IS USM 282112\\n\\nCanon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM 9021100944\\n\\nGura Gear Bataflae 26L Camera Backpack (Green)\\n\\nAny help in finding lost gear will also help.\\n\\nThank you so much. \\n\\n*EDIT: Formatting\\n\\n*EDIT: \\nThank you all for your support and suggestions!\\n\\nThere is quite some backstory to all this. I do have insurance through State Farm. I have the Personal Articles Policy.\\n\\nBut, I had that for my older gear (7D, 11-16mm, 100mm etc) which was $3700. I had informed my agent about my plans to buy new gear (6D, 16-35, 70-200 etc) on May 11th. After I found them (all used), they shipped and reached me it was the week of May 16th. I sent my agent an excel sheet of all my gear with serial numbers and costs etc on Friday (5/20/2016). She was out of office on that day and this happened on Sunday.\\n\\nSo, I\\'m still not sure if State Farm is going to cover me for this. My agent thinks they should but I guess I\\'ll have to wait for their system to get updated with my new gear and only then claims can take a look at it.\\n\\nNevertheless, I would still like to get my gear back. This trip was the first time my parents came to the US and it\\'s very memorable for me. I lost all those photos so I\\'m not ready to give up on the gear yet. . I spent a lot of time researching and studying monitor specs, color science, and photographic capabilities to try and decide what the best monitor for my needs would be. I have recently updated my computer set up and decided it was time to get a professional spec monitor to really step up my abilities. \\n\\n**TL;DR** Color Gamut and Bit Depth are probably the most important for some photographers, understand your output and that will dictate your requirements! Online only really means sRGB and 8bit, Online + Printing you\\'ll need AdobeRGB and 10bit. Resolution is up to you\\n\\nI had a pretty strict budget and reasonable expectations (I didn’t want to spend $4,000+ on an Eizo or Pro Display XDR) and wanted to spend that money as reasonably as possible. My needs were decent resolution, a wide color gamut, and a large display surface. I am printing more of my photos and find myself being disappointed that I don’t produce what my screen shows. For reference I am coming from a 2011 iMac and 2012 MacBook Pro Retina. \\n\\n*Note: This is not a review of a monitor or a personal recommendation, this is a synopsis of the information I learned when trying to make my own decision.* \\n\\n**Color Gamut**: This was the most important thing I found to improve my photography. A lot of research was done on my part into the science of color, which is a post for another day. \\n\\nMy decision was between two color gamut capabilities, sRGB and AdobeRGB. Most monitors you can purchase today are capable of sRGB. More professional oriented monitors expand the gamut capabilities to AdobeRGB. AdobeRGB is a larger color gamut than sRGB, it was created to encompass the color gamut of CMYK printers to more accurately represent the colors captured. Using sRGB for printing can leave colors out, for example you lose some green and cyan output ability if you print a photo in sRGB. Because of this I wanted a monitor that was capable of displaying the AdobeRGB gamut to accurately depict what my printer is capable of and therefore when I edit a photograph I will be editing within the capabilities of my printer and not my monitor. The below image shows the AdobeRGB gamut, sRGB, and a CMYK generic gamut. Notice that the CMYK is capable of showing more shades than sRGB, so capturing in sRGB and printing means you are not getting the fully \"picture.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[AbodeRGB, CMYK, and sRGB gamuts mapped on the CIE 1931 Chromaticity plot \\\\(original source unknown\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/iqltitn7ndk41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f34fba0e5720e9caf002bb41c19ecfbc2b12918)\\n\\nIf however you consume and output your photographs digitally and find your prints to be acceptable (if you even care about printing) than an sRGB monitor will be perfect and will not break the bank. A huge number of monitors exist that can display 100% of sRGB that are very inexpensive.\\n\\nIf you are like me and want to be able to see all of the colors your outputs are capable of (you can set most AdobeRGB monitors to display sRGB for digital editing) then you should be looking for not just a wide gamut monitor, but one capable of 95% or more of the AdobeRGB gamut. \\n\\n**Bit Depth**: There is A LOT of confusion about Bit Depth on monitors. There are three options generally out there for people who are advanced photographers, but maybe not a studio professional using a medium format camera. 8 Bit, “10 Bit”, and 10 Bit. The bit depth determines how many shades of one of the components of the display (Red, Green, Blue) can do from 100% brightness to 0%. 8 bit divides each color into 256 discrete values of brightness. Combining these 256 levels of Red, Green, and Blue leads to 16,777,216 “colors.” \\n\\n*Note: This is something that is in contention, the meaning of number of colors, I prescribe to the notion that it is 16.7 million discrete color values, which is the more technical definition and more accurate.*\\n\\nThere are two versions of 10 bit, true 10 bit and “10 bit”, otherwise known as 8 bit + FRC (Frame Rate Control). 10 bit depth means the device is capable of displaying 1,073,741,824 shades of color (in whatever gamut you have). \\n\\nFRC is a fancy trick monitors play with the frame rate of each pixel and surrounding pixels, effectively creating 4 shades (100%,75%, etc) behind the 256 shades of each pixel component (bringing the total to 1024 shades for each component). Some people have no issues with this, since technically the human eye can only perceive around 16 million shades of color, so 8 bit is all we can perceive. The issue however is when the color gamut gets larger. That means the Red, Green, and Blue components are further away from each other. If we send the signal to show shade 200 Green and 201 Green we can barely perceive the difference on an sRGB display, but since AdobeRGB has expanded into the Green region more, the difference between shade 200 and 201 of Green is larger, exacerbating the difference in shades. When comparing 8 bit to 10 bit, 1 shade in 8 bit color could be 4 different shades in 10 bit.\\n\\nUsing 10bit color then allows a more precise representation of colors with a finer resolution. Gradients will be smoother, which is the biggest benefit. Posterization will not be visible. In my situation having AdobeRGB required me to have a 10 bit capable monitor to avoid posterization. \\n\\n***ACHTUNG****: 10 bit displays need 10 bit output from your graphics card. Check your machines capabilities before purchasing a 10 bit monitor, unless you are future-proofing your setup. For your information, the MacBook Pro 16\" is capable of outputting 10 bit color on DisplayPort 1.4 (through the Thunderbolt Alt Mode).*\\n\\n**Resolution**: This is purely a personal preference in general. If you want 4K, then go for it. There are tons of 4K monitors on the market with sRGB coverage, there are fewer when you are looking for 4K and AdobeRGB. And then they start to get somewhat expensive. \\n\\nIn my search I worried over whether I needed 4K since so many screens have very large PPI (pixels per inch) and have some incredible perceived sharpness. There are arguments for and against these large resolution monitors. Some photographers prefer 1440p (2560x1440) on 27” screens as this allows then to view photos at 100%, which effectively would make them larger than on a 4K monitor. In addition some find it easier to judge critical focus on these 108 PPI screens (as opposed to >150PPI on a 4K screen). That being said, if you want a 32” monitor then a 4K resolution is very acceptable. \\n\\nAgain, resolution is a personal preference. I got over the worries that I NEEDED 4K, it opened up a lot more possibilities for monitors with AdobeRGB gamuts.\\n\\n**Size**: Again personal preference, I chose a 27” monitor. I felt 32” was excessive at the distance I would view it at, and found myself turning my head to view things at the edge of display. \\n\\nI think Resolution and Screen Size are something that should go hand in hand, shoot for a minimum of 108PPI. Balance your wants with your budget.\\n\\nMy Choice: I chose the BenQ SW270C. It is AdobeRGB 99% coverage, 1440p, 27”, and 10 bit capable. In addition it has USB-C connections making it easy for me to connect to. A nifty inclusion, which comes with a number of Professional grade monitors, is the monitor hood. It really cuts the side glare I get from the windows in my studio area and makes the screen really pop. I recommend that you consider all of your needs and how you shoot and distribute your photos.\\n\\nIn my opinion there are two true requirements that need to be balanced: Color Gamut-Bit Depth and Resolution-Size. This wasn’t very obvious to me at first, but these are things that should go hand in hand. Wider gamuts should have higher bit depths, and larger screens need larger resolutions (of course this is more of a personal preference)\\n\\nThere is nothing wrong with shooting and displaying in sRGB, really an AdobeRGB monitor is only going to be useful for some photographers. \\n\\nA Few Notes:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1. Color Gamut: There are hundreds of publications that explain the science of color. I recommend doing some research if you enjoy linear algebra and the science of human perception. However, the point I want to make is that if you set your camera to auto and leave it in JPEG you are probably capturing things in sRGB. Unless your camera is capable of capturing RAW or AdobeRGB and high color bit depth, a AdobeRGB monitor is not going to be very useful for you. Save your money and invest it in a RAW capable camera or some more education if you want to get into that level of photography. \\n2. Color Calibration: Out of the box most monitors are great, including the professional ones. However, calibration of a monitor can improve the performance and is necessary when you start printing fine art. Calibrating your monitor and your printer will make the outputs between the monitor and printer match more closely, making it much easier to edit your photos and get a great print sooner. If you plan on calibrating it is a good idea to find a monitor that allows for \"Hardware Calibration.\" This is calibrating the internal Look Up Tables (LUTs) of the monitor that allows for better and more accurate processing of the input signal from the computer (10bit to 16bit to 10bit). The LUTs allow the display to **accurately** display the colors from the computer. Each monitor does not have a linear response to each component, so increasing the depth to 16bit during the translation means that the output will be better matched to the displays capabilities.. \\n\\nI will be travelling to Japan on January 2024. And while I do own a DSLR (Nikon DF) and an APSC mirrorless Sony ZV-E10 with Sigma Trio lenses, I don’t think I will bring any of them. \\n\\nHence, if I’m using 14Pro as my primary camera, which app should I use? I plan to make use all these 3 lenses (wide normal tele) and shoot RAW if needed (for landscape). Or does the native camera app is adequate enough?\\n\\nIn the meantime, I am subscribed to Adobe CC so I have an access to Adobe LR in my phone. But I still need your opinions on which app is the best for photography. \\n\\nThanks..

I\\'m shooting my dad\\'s girlfriend\\'s daughter\\'s Sweet 16 and my camera just......shit out on me. Tried both memory cards, tried both batteries, and it just kept asking if I wanted to recover the photos on my SD cards (even when I took them out). \\n\\nOh ALSO this is my first ever party gig. \\n\\nI took some practice shots to adjust my camera to the lighting, and those worked. And then as soon as the first few guests show up it just......uhg. \\n\\nSo now I\\'m taking photos with my iPhone :( :( :( \\n\\nEDIT: I posted this while hiding in the bathroom desperately trying to fix my camera, so I\\'ll tell you guys what happened afterwards. I was very upset, but at the LEAST wanted to document the party, so I took pictures with my iPhone 6. Awkward awkward awkward. Then a miracle happened. Someone came late with a DSLR and I explained to them what happened and asked if I could borrow their camera. They were very, very nice and they said yes. I got some good photos (the iPhone ones were pretty shit TBH. The party was in a dimly lit bar/event room) with the camera and the IMPORTANT memories were captured (father/daughter dance, candle lighting ceremony). \\n\\nEven though I\\'ve had a (low-medium stress) photography-based job for a couple years, this made me rethink taking on parties/weddings and such in the future. Maybe when I get my shit together ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ who knows. . Hi! I\\'d really like to post a year-end reel with one of the audio templates that are popular at the moment, but I\\'ve just spent almost 2 hours trying to troubleshoot and come up with a way to keep my images sharp once they are uploaded into the reel. They\\'re professionally sharp in my iPhone camera roll, but embarrassingly soft when in-app. I tried using 3rd party reel makers but then I lose the template audio matching, and it\\'s still not sharp when I upload the exports.\\n\\nAll I see online are hundreds of people reporting the same issue and no one having a solution, and yet all I see on Instagram are other photographers with perfect images in their reels. I\\'m at my wits\\' end!\\n\\nI have high quality data upload switched on in the app, and I\\'ve tried every single combination of...\\n\\n* 72 vs 300 dpi\\n* 1080 vs 1920 longest edge (16:9 ratio)\\n* jpg vs png\\n* max MB vs under 2.4MB vs under 1MB\\n* Output sharpening for screen vs none\\n* Using a Lightroom export vs a Canva export with the image in one of their Instagram templates\\n\\nSomebody please tell me they\\'ve found a way to get around this issue! My business presence is falling way behind due to not having any decent reels to join the party with :(\\n\\nAny help would be HUGELY appreciated! Thank you!. Hello fellow photographers, I’m curious to know what do you tend to tell clients who have no specific need, the typical “What do you charge for a session” guys. My standard is 12-15 retouched images for something like u$s150.\\n\\nMore than anything I’m interested in knowing if you charge based on number of images, hourly rate or something else. In my case I charge for image (although I have a minimum rate).\\n\\nCheers from Buenos Aires!\\n\\n[Edit] Just to clarify, the average salary in my city is roughly u$s550, way lower than it\\'s stated in the comments. That\\'s because those sources are not updated. Argentina went from US$1=AR$16 to US$1=AR$35 in two months last july, so yeah.... [Update] - _Thank you all so much for the awesome show of support!  I really appreciate it (and so do the devs).  Just a note, the list I posted in the comments below is not exhaustive.  So if you have something that is not on the list, please still consider checking the site and seeing if we are missing your files (or need better/better-licensed ones)!_\\n\\nHello all!\\n\\nI am trying to help out the Free Software developers of raw processing libraries by asking others if they would be kind enough to donate a raw file for them to use as part of their testing.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t need to be anything fancy, though we do ask that you check first to see if something from your camera has already been uploaded (and we would prefer a color chart over a normal image, if you happen to have one).\\n\\nIt would be awesome if anyone in the community could just take a few minutes and see if they have something that isn\\'t there (or is better).  Remember - it doesn\\'t have to be anything special - any plain old snapshot would be fine!\\n\\nIf you think you can help and are willing to license the image CC0 (Public Domain), then please head over here to upload something:\\n\\n**https://raw.pixls.us**\\n\\n_Thank you so much!_\\n\\n---\\nWe are looking for shots that are:\\n\\n* Lens mounted on the camera, cap off\\n* Image in focus and properly exposed\\n* Landscape orientation\\n\\nWe are not looking for:\\n\\n* Series of images with different ISO, aperture, shutter, wb, lighting, or different lenses\\n* DNG files created with Adobe DNG Converter\\n* Photographs of people, for legal reasons\\n\\nOf the following brands we like to have:\\n\\n* **Panasonic:** all the crops (1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9).\\n* **Nikon & Sony:** all the combinations of compression and bitness settings, that is:\\n * 12bit-compressed\\n * 12bit-uncompressed\\n * 12bit-lossless-compressed\\n * 14bit-compressed\\n * 14bit-uncompressed\\n * 14bit-lossless-compressed\\n* **Canon:** RAW, mRAW, sRAW.\\n* **Canon (CHDK):** Both the old-style CRW, and new DNG.\\n* **Leica:** Both compressed and uncompressed and all the crops (1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9).\\n* **Pentax:** Both PEF and DNG.. I know  there\\'s a lot of unjust controversy right now about iPhone XS skin  smoothing (actually, it\\'s just aggressive noise reduction). Well, it  turns out the Apple Photos RAW engine is guilty of the same thing.\\n\\nCompare  these 100% crops from both Apple Photos and Lightroom. Both are 100%  unedited. No noise reduction applied by me. The camera is a Sony a6000  at ISO 4000 and RAW only, not RAW+JPEG. Both images exported out of  their respective applications as uncompressed TIFF files.\\n\\nIf  you select both files and A/B them using macOS QuickLook (or by toggling as 2 Photoshop layers), the difference is  shocking. The Photos version literally looks like a bad JPEG. You might  be thinking that this is indeed just Photos own JPEG preview, but no, it  looks this bad in Edit mode too. The ISO noise is \\\\*gone\\\\*, and with it,  most of the fine detail. That should be MY decision to make. Please  Apple, honor the original sensor data. Also the color detail from Photos  is poor.\\n\\nI  wish I had figured this out \\\\*before\\\\* uploading 700GB of RAW files to  iCloud and paying $9.99 for the 1TB plan. My own dumb fault. Guess I\\'ll  be cancelling that plan immediately.\\n\\nLightroom TIFF (50MB)\\n\\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/idrpccppvfe8bej/raw\\\\_adobe\\\\_lightroom.tif?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/idrpccppvfe8bej/raw_adobe_lightroom.tif?dl=1)\\n\\nPhotos TIFF (22MB)\\n\\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/mpjfd9flf95gmuh/raw\\\\_apple\\\\_photos.tif?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mpjfd9flf95gmuh/raw_apple_photos.tif?dl=1)\\n\\nOriginal RAW (25MB)\\n\\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/nf74fm94ceu9cj1/DSC00944.ARW?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nf74fm94ceu9cj1/DSC00944.ARW?dl=1)\\n\\nI\\'ve submitted feedback to Apple. Just thought I\\'d post my findings here to see if anyone else has experienced this.. Instagram is so 2010. It was made in that age, and even wasn\\'t made for photographers. It was made to emulate photography with first iPhone devices by using filters that emulate film photography. Now that days are gone. Mobile phone screens ain\\'t 3 inches anymore, while Instagram still assuming that they are. We don\\'t need that tiny three photos squared layout, we could make it like 5 or even 6 and it would be completely plausible on modern devices and also we can make it flickr/pinterest type of layout (or combination of both), without any cropping, so photos with non-centered composition wouldn\\'t have faces cutted in half, or most interesting things that happening in the corner (which is complete normal for casual classic photography) are not even shown (and I\\'m not even talking about panoramas or 16:9 shots, where you can get nothing really shown in your profile grid, after Instagram would crop the central part to make a pic for a grid). We could have such a great platform just by slight upgrades to the current Instagram layout and by adding simplest features, like the ability to rotate the photo (so any horizontal shot would be able to seen normally, not in tiny window) and watch it full-screen. \\n\\nWhat the matters Instagram? I want to ask you, but I heard (it\\'s widely known fact) that facebook bought Instagram not to develop its functional further, but exactly in reverse way - to stop it from evolving. Facebook management was afraid that Instagram would take over the Facebook in popularity, so they bought it exactly to stop its development and to prevent the Facebook to being overshadowed by Instagram popularity, so, I assume, they perfectly know what happening and what needed to be imlemented, by they not just not doing it - they are deliberately not implementing it due to reasons of keeping Facebook top one and most popular platform and that is the exact reason why former management of Instagram, including its creators, left the project after saying that Facebook ain\\'t see Instagram\\'s future as they see and the Facebook preventing them from development and implementing new features so, basically Facebook spoiling the process of development and they have completely different view on how Instagram should look. That\\'s is the really serious matter, because Instagram is the thing photographer basically OBLIGATED to have in 2022 and so we basically are being hostages to Facebook\\'s policies about restricting of Instagram develompment. What do you think?. I\\'m feeling very down and rather than giving up forever, I\\'m using this failure as hopefully a learning tool. For reference I\\'m using a Nikon D7000, shooting raw, kit lense 18-70 (I think, honestly I\\'m in bed and am too lady to check right now.. if it matters to people I\\'ll update tomorrow)\\n\\nI just got home from my first family vacation ever. I took my wife and daughter to California to Disneyland and to the beach. As someone who has dabbled in landscape Astrophotography I have very little experience with anything else. I didn\\'t want my first vacay to be ruined by me trying to shoot manual on everything, so I figured I\\'d trust the camera. I put my camera on auto, go to take a picture and... Nothing. I couldn\\'t get the shutter to close and take a picture. Rather than messing with it in the moment to fix what I\\'m sure was a user error, I put it in \"scene\" more to sport or action mode. I figured the camera would snap a bunch of pictures quickly, and I could pick which ones I wanted to keep later.  \\n\\nFast forward to that evening, like an eager Beaver I plug my SD card into my computer, and ALL 150-some of my pictures look like I used a disposable camera from the \\'90\\'s. It was so disappointing, they were all grainy and washed out! On the bright side (if I have to find one) we have press from my wife\\'s iPhone of our daughters first experience at Disney. \\n\\nFast forward to the next day when we at the beach, completely terrified the same experience will occur, I figure out the \"Auto\" function on camera, and take another few hundred pictures. The photos that evening on the computer we a little better, but not much. I\\'m still highly disappointed. In the 400-450 photos I took, I really only wanted to save about 15 of them enough to show anyone else. \\n\\nFeeling so discouraged, any advice or anecdotes to bring me out of my gloomy outlook on the situation is appreciated!\\n\\nEdit:\\nWow, this post really blew up! Guys and gals giving posts, thank you! I will post pictures and some stats along with them tomorrow. I\\'m a music teacher in concert season, so I\\'m really busy this week and this is my only time to check Reddit. Thank you again everyone!. Hey, photo lovers!\\n\\nAnother year passed and I’m here with the renewed list of photo editing software.\\n\\nThe short story behind this list: I’ve started this research for my project [Photolemur](https://photolemur.sjv.io/nLVm6) in July 2016.\\n\\nThe first list was \\'61 Photo Editing Tools and Apps\\'. After the very first post in 2016, I’ve got a lot of suggestions from redditors and decided to complete another list [104 Photo Editing Tools You Should Know About](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/50613q/104_photo_editing_tools_you_should_know_about/).\\n\\nThen, Michael Zhang, Petapixel’s Editor, asked me to repost this list on Petapixel. The article got 5,419 shares and tons of comments with a new portion of great tools for photo editing. The next list came with [148 photo editing tools](https://petapixel.com/2016/11/01/148-photo-editing-tools-apps/) Then, ten months after, I’ve published a new list [186 photo editing tools and apps. The biggest list ever existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/72sg6a/186_photo_editing_tools_and_apps_the_biggest_list/).\\n\\nToday I’m no longer with Photolemur (I’ve left Photolemur a week ago). But I decided to continue doing this research. And the next steps will be putting all this software to the website with filters and user rating option. Actually, I’ve already bought the domain :) [photo-index.com](http://www.photo-index.com)\\n\\nIf someone of you, redditors wants to help me with building the website - just send me a message.\\n\\n**What has changed in the new list:**\\n\\nSome of the apps had gone away from the market (you’ll find them in the list). Also, during my new research, I’ve found that there is almost 100 photo editing mobile apps on the market (in the previous list there were only 31 mobile apps). And I decided to create the separate list of photo editing mobile apps. It will be live very soon! So, there is no mobile apps section in this list. I’ve got a lot of comments about including some kind of recommendations to the list. So, the first 5 to 10 items in each section are the best one (in my personal opinion).\\n\\nAs always, I want to say thank you, redditors!\\n\\nIn the beginning, there were only 61 photo tools, and I thought that it’s a huge list!  :)\\n\\n**Now we have the list of 210 tools for photo editing and photo manipulation (excluding 97 mobile apps)!**\\n\\n* Enhancers (10)\\n* Cross-platform image editors (5)\\n* Online photo editors (16)\\n* Paid Desktop Photo Editors (26)\\n* Free Desktop Photo Editors (14)\\n* RAW Processors (21)\\n* HDR photo editors (15)\\n* Photo viewers and managers (17)\\n* Face Editing Software (9)\\n* Image Enlargers & Resizing Software (15) ^(new)\\n* Photo Utilities, Plugins, Filters & Effects (62)\\n\\n**Photo Enhancers**\\n\\n1.[Photolemur](https://photolemur.sjv.io/nLVm6) Fully automated photo enhancement solution to make all photos perfect.

When I look at things I see emotion and try and capture how it makes me feel. But when I take the picture and it’s not what I saw or wanted others too see it frustrates me. I’ve gone out onto my roof for the past 3-4 days trying to catch the same blue to yellow sunset and every time I snap the photo at the time it makes me feel alone but hopeful I look at my phone and realize it looks like crap and all it captures is my fuzzy camera struggling in the dark. Now I get it it’s a phone camera on a iPhone 6 what should I expect? Haha well I would buy a camera but I’m saving up for one and aren’t even close. When you guys don’t get the picture right after taking it hundreds of times what do you do? Buy a better camera? Try a different angle? Forget the feeling all together? I’m just lost but yet I keep taking photos cause I’d like to look back at them and remember why I took it and how many times I took to get the shot right. any advice would be greatly appreciated thanks.. I\\'m trying to look for in-depth reviews comparing Luminar 4 against Capture One. Most reviews are just comparing it to Lightroom.\\n\\nI \\'ve been using Capture One since \\\\~2 years ago but I still have Lightroom Classic for my old photos. I think overall Capture One is a positive change for me, but I\\'m not super satisfied with it. What I like:\\n\\n* Layers and masking is so, so nice. Hardly ever need PS / Affinity Photo\\n* The Sessions workflow makes more sense to how I organise my files\\n* Performance was a lot better on my old MBA. Not much difference since I upgraded to a 16\" MBP.  \\n\\n\\nWhat I don\\'t like:\\n\\n* They keep charging for updates that I don\\'t think is worth the asking price. I know I can just NOT update, but I expect a perpetual license software should come with regular updates and free minor improvements after a few years.\\n* Not a fan of the UI e.g. often-used buttons have tiny icons, browser thumbnail doesn\\'t just show the cropped version, etc.\\n* Any temporary changes to a process recipe gets saved to the recipe (am I doing this wrong?)\\n\\nHas anyone here moved from Capture One to Luminar? I\\'d love to hear your thoughts, please. What do you like and what do you miss?. Over the years I\\'ve taken so much from this site in terms of insight, advice, and opinions from my fellow photogs- for that I thank you and today I wanted to give a little back.... in terms of a review for tripod/ballhead which in my opinion just might be some of the best gear many of you might never have heard of, I know I hadn\\'t known of them until recently: http://www.desphotodist.com\\n\\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Vq5S5KJl.jpg)\\n\\nI\\'m an Outside shooter, that just means I\\'m game for just about anything if it gets me outside. But primarily landscapes and nightcaps is what I seem to gravitate towards and often in conditions that aren\\'t the most favorable. Living in the PNW not only has an incredible diversity of weather, but of terrain too....Oceans, mountains,desert...you name it. and gear needs to work in all climates and weather.\\n\\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KJ05k8il.jpg)\\n\\n\\nMy kit revolves around Nikon d810, and several lenses consisting of 16-35mm f4, 70-200mm f2.8, 28-75mm f2.8 and 14mm f2.8. Nothing too extreme here, all just good solid stuff.... all stuffed in a MindShift backlight 26L.\\n\\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KRqTvDel.jpg)\\n\\n\\nAlright, so most recently I\\'ve been using a 3legged thing Travis, which accomplished several goals; cheap, reasonably light weight, portable, and very pretty to look at. However the one goal which it does not due very well is Sturdy. maybe ok for 4/3 kit, but not my kit. \\n\\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GAR4pMml.jpg)\\n\\nSo I was off to find a tripod to change that one (actually 2) very important function(s). Sturdy and inexpensive. My search lead me to Desmond photo and I was immediately intrigued by the 32mm Carbon Fiber 8 wrap legs, this I had to try.... and to top it off they had an option to include a massive 46mm Ball head...and get this, the retail price was only $239 for the whole deal. Sold.\\n\\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pHCQCsZl.jpg)\\n\\n\\nFirst impressions; it was light, big and gorgeous. Came with a bag (which I\\'ll never use), 4 hex keys, short center column and instructions (also the rubber feet pull off and steel spikes are revealed!). The 32mm Legs are massive, the red anodizing highlights are beautiful and the Demon DB-46 ball head is huge. I\\'m 6\\'2\" and fully extended (all 3 sections with center column) I can\\'t see my screen unless I stand on something, but even fully extended its rock steady (comparatively to most other tripods, I mean its 32mm of CF- its stiff).\\n\\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mS6pGpkl.jpg)\\n\\n\\nNow everything about this set up is Overkill for me, but for the first time I don\\'t mind, as its the right kind of overkill. Surprisingly, its only about 1 pound weight difference from the 3legged thing travis I\\'ve been using, and to get this sort of stability with only a about 1 pound weight penalty is amazing to me. (now its also about 2in longer fully collapsed, however it still fits into my MindShift 26L bag side pocket very securely).\\n\\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Blz6Ushl.jpg)\\n\\n\\nNow I\\'ve had the chance to shoot about 20+ times over the last month of so with this set up, several long hikes and many park and shoots too. The action on the legs is quick and easy, as well as quite smooth. The Db-46 action is butter smooth in all directions, lock down is super secure. The pan action is just perfect and I love the built-in levels(4). I shot in some fairly windy conditions and a got nice sharp clean images. Pano\\'s are my gas:\\n\\n\\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/dP0JPx2l.jpg)\\n\\n\\nIf I was to do all over again, what would I change. I would have likely stepped down a model (I thinks its dcf-428/demon db-40), as I would have saved just shy of a pound and got very close to the same stability (as well as saved another $40).\\n\\n\\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0pwUhJZl.jpg)\\n\\n\\nI will add, the product I think would be my absolute dream set up would like: DCF-432 but the leg sections would be 1-2in shorter, but add a 4th leg section, short center column and a Demon DB-34mm....of course none of this exists, at least yet. But regardless I\\'m very happy with the current version DCF-432/Demon DB-46- the value, weight, stability and action is outstanding. Here a a few more shots in action on a night shoot a few poor iPhone shots but you get the idea). So if your consider a new tripod these are with a look.\\n\\n\\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BgJ4vlnl.jpg)\\n\\n\\n*Edited per Desmond Specs;\\n\\nDCF-432 Tripod Specs :\\n\\nDesmond DCF-432 Tripod Legs 4 Section Carbon Fiber.

In the eyes of your novice photographer, I am a near enough to a professional. So, I know a little bit about photography but not enough to even begin to comprehend what might be going on here. \\n\\nHi - sorry if I break any rules! \\n\\nI went flying with a friend the other day and I noticed after reviewing the photos there is a large amount of noise within them. \\n\\nLink: [http://imgur.com/a/nT4nc](http://imgur.com/a/nT4nc)\\n\\nThe lighting should be sufficient enough (other than the last on) to take photos without that amount of noise. Heck, I took [this](http://imgur.com/pSRRNqr) photo with my iPhone 4S! Admittedly nowhere near the size but there is visibly less noise. \\n\\nAny help in what is going on here is much appreciated! Plus any help with regards to reducing noise pre-edit I would be very grateful!\\n\\nUPDATE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/3t7su5/d3200_high_noise_at_iso_100_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/3t7su5/d3200_high_noise_at_iso_100_update/). So, my sister is planning on getting married in a remote part of the UK. After shopping around pro\\'s that could do the event, only one got back to her and their quote was way out of her budget... I said that I could do it for her in a pinch, but with my lack of experience in event photography ( i prefer landscape ), i\\'d be more comfortable with more candid stuff, which she seemed okay with. At the same time though, I\\'d like to do it justice and try to up my game...\\n\\nSo, I was hoping to get a second opinion of my gear to see if you guys think that I could get by with what I have and if not, what my options are.\\n\\n* Nikon D40\\n* Nikon 18-55mm 1:3.5-5.6G AF-S DX ED II ( Kit lens supplied with D40 - seen better days ) \\n* Nikon D7000\\n* Tokina AT-X PRO 11-16mm F/2.8 DX \\n* Nikon 35 mm F/1.8 AF-S G\\n* Nikon 55-200mm F/4-5.6 AF-S VR DX ( Not the new VRII )\\n* Nikon AF-S VR Micro 105mm F/2.8G IF-ED\\n\\nMy thinking was that the D40 won\\'t be a fit second camera considering the importance of getting a great shot first time.\\n\\nI was thinking of investing in a newer body and was tempted with the D7500 - relegating my D7000 to backup. It is just within the limit of not making my wallet cry...\\n\\nLens-wise, I was tempted with adding the Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 16-80 mm f/2.8-4E ED VR to my kit. It seems to be sharp, good in lower light and covers a nice range indoors.\\n\\nI won\\'t lie - it is giving me a reason to splurge and update my kit a little bit! I\\'ve got a fair bit of time to spread the investments and get a lot of practise in!\\n\\nSo yeah - any thoughts you all might have on everything would be very much appreciated indeed!. Hey guys!\\n\\nI\\'m finally getting myself a Nikon D7k, my first DSLR (I\\'ve been shooting film for a while and I have an m43 camera and lenses). I\\'m getting it at Best Buy on their card. They offer two bundles with some money off Nikon lenses.\\n\\nFor an extra [$150 I can get the 55-200 VR](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Nikon+D7000+16.2MP+DSLR+Camera+and+Extra+55-200mm+VR+Lens/9999151300050002.p;jsessionid=8F25E9D563ECD49A4B9496166D192684.bbolsp-app01-36?id=pcmprd151300050002&skuId=9999151300050002&st=nikon%20d7000&lp=2&cp=1) or [For $250 I can get the 55-300 VR](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Nikon+D7000+16.2MP+DSLR+Camera+and+Extra+55-300mm+VR+Lens/9999151300050003.p;jsessionid=8F25E9D563ECD49A4B9496166D192684.bbolsp-app01-36?id=pcmprd151300050003&skuId=9999151300050003&st=nikon%20d7000&lp=3&cp=1).\\n\\nThe nice thing would be having the versatility these zooms will offer until I can afford some nicer glass. I\\'m also getting the 35,50 and 85 primes in the near future, so I\\'ll have that. My plan is to have this body for a while and use it as a second when I get a full-frame body (not anytime soon).\\n\\nI\\'ve been obsessed with studio and fashion photography for a while and I want to do more with that, so the speed isn\\'t an issue since I\\'ll be shooting with lights mostly, or primes when I have to shoot natural. I might be able to score some work on the side shooting bands in the area as well. The thing I don\\'t like is that these won\\'t carry over to a full-frame body like a prime would, but since I\\'m keeping the camera, it\\'s not too bad of a problem.\\n\\nAnyway, I wanted to get an opinion on whether it makes sense to pick one of these up at the discount or if I\\'m better off with something else/not getting them because they\\'re not that good. They\\'re both reviewed ok and take decent enough pictures from what I\\'ve seen, but I don\\'t have any personal experiences. If anybody has any experience with these lenses, that would be great as well.\\n\\nThanks so much!\\n\\n**UPDATE: Thanks for all the suggestions/help. To clarify, I will be getting a 35mm of some sort right away! I know it\\'s a great lens and all the advantages it will offer me. I was more wondering what the opinion was on the 55-200 and 55-300 and if they were worth it. It seems like the 55-200 is easily worth $150, so I\\'ll probably get that. When money allows, I will sell off one or both of the lenses and get the 18-200 VR, based on suggestions.**. Hello guys. I\\'m a newbie here but an oldie in photography. I am reaching retirement age and my plan after that is to devote my time doing photography. Teaching has always been my passion, unfortunately it\\'s not a good paying job so I settled to being ang engineer. But I do plan to teach for free when I retire. I want to do things that I was never able to do when I am still working.\\n\\nMy approach to photography has never been technical and I am more driven with photos that I like rather go into the technical part. I am also not inclined to pixel peep and as long as the picture looks great , I don\\'t care about the ISO or aperture and shutter speed. The immediate feedback given by the screen after every shoot has helped me a lot in my photography. during my film days , I spend a lot on polaroid backs to get my lighting right.\\n\\nMy approach to photography has been to use many low power off camera flash as light sources that enhance the image. I used a low end DSLR, namely a Canon 600D and multiple Yongnou Flashes in many of my photographs and a Ultra wide angle lens, a 17-40mm L lens and a 70-200 mmm L Lens.\\n\\nLately because of scoliosis I am no longer inclined to carry the heavy stuff. And have long wanted no use smartphones, but the absence of External Flashes for the smartphone has prevented me to embrace smartphones as my main photographic tool. I have the GODOX A1 but its limitation on sync speed left me unsatisfied.\\n\\nThings change this year when Innovatronix, the maker of the Explorer series of Battery powered packs released the CPFlash 550W. For the first time there is an Off Camera Flash that works reliably with a smartphone. Because it is a short burst of continuous LED Light, It will sync with any smartphones at any shutter speed. I have actually tried synching it up to 1/10,000 of a second.\\n\\nThe CPFlash 550W is a powerful Tri-Function flash and works as flash for smartphones, a flash for DSLRs and Mirrorless cameras and as a video light with different effects. Its power is equivalent to a 60WS speedlights the likes of the Canon 580EX and the Nikon SB900, Yongnou and Godox speedlights. It also comes complete with accessories such as magnetic filters , Smartphone camera trigger, DSLR/Mirrorless Hot Shoe Trigger, bracket and charging cable.\\n\\nThe manufacturer claims that it works with all iPhones and Android Smartphones and it also works with all camera native and downloaded camera apps for all smartphones. So far I have tested the unit on my wife\\'s iPhone 11 Pro, My Son\\'s Samsung S10 and OPPO Smartphones and of course my Huawei P30 and it all works flawlessly.\\n\\nPlease feel free to ask your questions as I love to teach and hopefully you will learn something new from me. Also for the studio and flash experts here, please correct me if I make a mistake as I am not an expert nor a professional photographer.\\n\\nHere are some picture using multiple External Flash Taken during my DSLR Days :\\n\\n[ Canon EOS 600D F8, 1\\\\/125S , ISO200 28mm ](https://preview.redd.it/1tyaatcdkxh61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6a0adc4bf0283855abfd95eba25a2b5286a01cf)\\n\\n[ Canon 600D, F8, 1\\\\/100S, ISO100, 50mm ](https://preview.redd.it/wrm7205fkxh61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be764b9e15614684c2e8979e3a81573a0e067491)\\n\\n[ Canon EOS600D, F11, 1\\\\/50S, ISO200, 10mm ](https://preview.redd.it/418pw3ijkxh61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2a16424f8af396bf9a4508d6340d05b01a27b39)\\n\\n[ Canon EOS400D, F7.1, 1\\\\/30S, ISO400, 10mm ](https://preview.redd.it/4xrvycqlkxh61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb4580a332bd22de7f54f9d76f679f044dcc4857)\\n\\nAside from a lower resolution image compared to a DSLR/Mirrorless image, There are 2 remaining areas where smartphones are not recommended. This will probably change in the next few years as camera development for the smartphones are progressing in a breathtaking speed.\\n\\nHere is a picture (not mine) that won second place in the very prestigious HIPA Photography Contest. As you can see in the picture. Background blurring via computational photography has come a very long way and that smartphones can now mimic a large aperture lenses with a few hand strokes.

If your smartphone does not have a manual mode, you can purchase a camera app with a manual (sometimes called PRO) mode.\\n\\nLightroom can be downloaded for free for both Android and iOS phones and there are hundreds of camera apps that cost from Free to US$10 for any phone. A manual mode is very important as it is very hard to control the lighting of a smartphone (Similar to a DSLR/Mirrorless) in program mode.The CPFLASH does not have FLASH TTL Capability.\\n\\nHere is my basic Gear for my Smartphone OCF Photography\\n\\n1.

Please take note that a smartphone aperture cannot be adjusted and fixed with a value from f1.3 to f2.2.\\n\\nSo to start with my tutorial here is a shot that i recently took in a studio. This is a 2 off camera shoot. One off camera is used as a hair light the other off camera flash was used as a main light.Main light power was at 30% while the Hair light power was set in the smartphone at 100%.\\n\\n[ Huawei P30 , F1.6, 1\\\\/200S, ISO 400, 6mm ](https://preview.redd.it/x3rgf61ykxh61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c24afa1a1bb0568fb7357ac163fe88a7b0a30be6)\\n\\nHere is the diagram of the shoot.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0zwuf70lxh61.jpg?width=1921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10562ad0898272d5c4abcea527aec7f7c4414a41\\n\\nHere is another variation of that shoot.\\n\\n[ Huawei P30, F1.6, 1\\\\/200S, ISO400, 6mm ](https://preview.redd.it/h4jym552lxh61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37dbc815d5b334d61a4faba32babd42319aa7745)\\n\\nHere is a diagram of the shoot.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nnfyt734lxh61.jpg?width=1921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3928a4a4f53cf7dfe5d127a5cebcbe715de5d36\\n\\nHere is the smartphone shoot without off camera lights.\\n\\n[ Shot in automatic mode Huawei P30, F2.2 1\\\\/17S, ISO1000, 2mm ](https://preview.redd.it/0hpmycm6lxh61.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e7a10e96043aff07af68d6617d6aebdbd30374d)\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/433zs029lxh61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3bfcc3dc6b315434fab56bc19a17c300cbe33a2\\n\\nNext time I will be showing you more examples of my shoot.

Do you know the difference between a lossless and lossy file? For instance, do you know when to set your camera to record images on JPEG or RAW? As a retired scientist and self-proclaimed geek, I often find myself obsessing about every single little detail. Whenever I face a new subject, I quickly find myself digging through the endless internet universe. Usually, my initial research creates more questions, and I end up spending days learning about a topic that shouldn\\'t take more than 10 minutes of my life. In this post, I promise to share everything that I\\'ve learned about the different image file formats available to us – photographers. All I ask for is 15 minutes of your attention.\\n\\nAre you ready? Let\\'s do it; I promise it will be fun.\\n\\n1. Lossless vs. Lossy file:\\n\\nInstead of starting this post explaining the difference between the files, I want to briefly explain the first essential concept we should learn about digital files – file compression. All digital data are compressed to be recorded. However, the compression method used during the data acquisition (a.k.a, capturing the image) can drastically change our ability to use those data later in post-processing. In general, data compression is divided into two main categories – Lossless and Lossy. The main difference between these two methods is that while Lossless format records data without losing data, the lossy compression \"drops\" unnecessary or redundant information to reduce file size \\\\[1\\\\].\\n\\nThe advance of digital photography during 1980 started to create standards for image compression. Initially, the cameras only captured images in Lossless format. The quick expansion of the digital format added to the costs of storage forced the industry to start using a lossy compression method. And that\\'s how JPEG became one of the most ubiquitous image formats in the digital space.\\n\\n2. RAW vs. JPEG file:\\n\\nThe RAW vs. JPEG comparison is the most relevant for photographers. So, I decided to dedicate a special session to compare these two formats. And since you – the astute reader – already understand the difference between the different compression types, I\\'m confident that you have already started to visualize the differences between RAW and JPEG. While the RAW file uses a capture method that records images without losing data, the JPEG file ignores some original data to compress the final file.\\n\\nIn light of this information, you are probably wondering why that\\'s important for your photography. In fact, I didn\\'t understand why those large and hard-to-work with RAW files were appealing for some photographers. Why not just use JPEG format? A format that can be easily opened by our computer? And those were the questions that made me keep using JPEG even after buying my first RAW capable DSLR camera.\\n\\nBut, after some research, I realized the magical power of shooting using the RAW format. In brief, the data captured by a camera using the RAW format allows photographers to post-process images more robustly. In fact, a RAW image straight out of the camera usually looks very flat with muted colors. And that\\'s why I like to imagine the RAW format as a film negative and JPEG as a developed image.\\n\\n3. Practical aspects:\\n\\nCongratulations, you made it through the first session. You read the most technical part of this post, and that\\'s pretty awesome. Now, you\\'re equipped with enough information about digital file compression to impress your friends on the next trivia night. But why stop now? Let\\'s move forward, and use this solid base to explore the practical aspects of those different image file formats. In the following comparisons, I will also explain a few other Lossless formats widely used in photography – TIFF, PNG, DNG, and PSD.\\n\\nJPEG:\\n\\nLet\\'s start the conversation with the only Lossy format in this list. The JPEG acronym stands for Joint Photography Experts Group, and it was first introduced to the public back in 1992. With a compression rate of approximately 10:1, JPEG quickly became the industry standard for sharing digital images over the internet. The significant advantages of the JPEG format are the file size and ease of use. The combination of small file size and visualization ability without specialized software makes the JPEG format extremely convenient to work and store images. More recently, another factor supporting the exponential JPEG growth was the creation and expansion of the internet and social media platforms. The majority of sites and social media only accept the JPEG format.\\n\\nBut it would be best if you didn\\'t get lured by all the benefits of JPEG files. In fact, the JPEG format is far from perfect when it comes down to capturing images. When you set your camera to JPEG, you allow the camera algorithm to decide key artistic and creative factors.\\n\\nWait; what? Yes, that\\'s right. To discard \"irrelevant\" information to compress the file, your camera decides on key image factors such as contrast, vibrance, saturation, among others. That\\'s the reason why a JPEG image will always look better than a RAW image straight out of the camera. And since the captured file has lost a lot of information during the recording stage, you will not be able to make any major adjustments to the file after the capture. Imagine JPEG files as a printed image. Once you have it on your hands, it will be tough to make any significant change.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nSmall Files\\n\\nEasy to use\\n\\nWidely accepted on the Internet.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nNot suitable for post-processing\\n\\nLower image quality\\n\\nRAW:\\n\\nFirst, it\\'s essential to realize that each camera manufacturer will have its own proprietary RAW format. For example, Canon RAW images have a CR2 extension, while Nikon raw files are recorded as NEF files. Back in the day, it could be a challenge to find software to open your RAW file. Back in 2012, I remember having to wait for Adobe to release a Lightroom update so I could open the raw files from my brand-new Canon 6D. This seems to be less of a challenge nowadays since Adobe Cloud provides daily updates.\\n\\nBut, all that initial pain of working with the RAW format quickly disappears when you discover the power of having all the information recorded in each image file. Since the RAW files are digital negatives, you have the ability to develop your images in ways that will express your artistic view. Because the RAW files are very bland straight from the camera, anyone using this format should be ready to dip their toes in the post-processing world. Whether you decide to spend hours tweaking the colors using specialized post-processing software or just making global adjustments utilizing your camera manufacturer\\'s software, you will have to allocate time to develop your RAW file.\\n\\nAs someone that thoroughly enjoys spending hours on post-processing, I love capturing all my images using the RAW format. After years of photography, I have finally developed a backup system with plenty of redundancy and space to store large files. Thus, since I have the necessity of editing my images to create appealing photos to sell for clients and storage space is not critical, I feel that the RAW format is the only logical choice for me.\\n\\nBE REALISTIC ABOUT YOUR NECESSITIES.\\n\\nBefore you start shooting in RAW format, I would strongly advise you to stop and reflect on your goals. Is storage space an issue for you? Are you ready to buy extra hard-drives or to subscribe to cloud storage services? Do you have the patience to develop your RAW files? If yes - the RAW format is the one for you. But if you said no to one of those two points, maybe you should consider using the JPEG format.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nBest format for post-processing\\n\\nNot compressed\\n\\nMore leeway adjusting colors, highlights, and shadows\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nLarge file size\\n\\nRequires specialized software to open\\n\\nNot suitable to share over the internet\\n\\nTIFF:\\n\\nYes, my Canadian friends might believe that TIFF stands for the Toronto International Film Festival. But, for us photographers, the TIFF acronym stands for Tagged Image File Format. This Lossless format is broadly used for printing purposes, as the format can store up to 16.7 million colors and be easily converted to CMYK color space. The TIFF file was first introduced in 1986 and quickly became the format of choice among graphical artists, publishers, and photographers planning on printing their work. The TIFF file can be easily open on any computer, as it doesn\\'t require specialized software. But, its large size makes this file format not suitable for sharing and distributing over the internet.\\n\\nUsually, the uncompressed nature of the TIFF files is suitable for post-processing. Despite the ease of use of TIFF files, they are often larger than the RAW format, making it hard to justify using such a format for storage. Thus, photographers only use this format for printing purposes.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nUncompressed format\\n\\nPossible to convert to CMYK color space\\n\\nIt does not require specialized software.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nLarge file size\\n\\nNot suitable to share over the internet\\n\\nProprietary Files - The Adobe story:\\n\\nAdobe software solutions have been around since the beginning of the digital era. The company has pioneered several (if not all) fields of digital art. This constant drive for innovation consolidated Adobe as one of the leading software developers in the photography world. Nowadays, Photoshop and Lightroom represent a large share of the photo editing software market. And the two main proprietary file formats from Adobe are PSD and DNG.\\n\\nDNG:\\n\\nThe DNG format was created to standardize RAW files. By converting the RAW file from camera manufacturers to DNG format, users could open all different RAW files using any Adobe software. This was particularly relevant before the transition to Adobe Creative Cloud (CC). Before the Creative Cloud, users would buy Adobe software and keep using that software for years before upgrading to a newer version. However, sometimes the \"old\" software didn\\'t support the new cameras\\' new RAW files. The solution to this problem? The DNG Converter software. After buying a new camera, photographers had to download the free DNG Converter to transform the RAW files into DNG before editing the Photoshop or Lightroom images.\\n\\nNowadays, with the constant updates from Creative Cloud, users don\\'t have to worry about this extra step – as all the algorithms to convert the new RAW files are quickly incorporated in Lightroom.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nUncompressed format\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nIt requires an extra step in your workflow\\n\\nPSD:\\n\\nOne of the most popular software in the digital art space, Photoshop, was first introduced in 1988 \\\\[2\\\\]. Its presence among digital artists is so ubiquitous that the software\\'s name became an actual verb in the English language. Photoshop is one of the most powerful and complex software used for photo-editing – watch this video to learn more about Photoshop and this long-tutorial to see how to use it during Post-Processing. Personally, I use Photoshop daily to edit my photos and to create digital art (such as banners and ads) for clients. Now, you, as a photographer, might be asking why I would save an image in the PSD format?\\n\\nThe straight answer is – because PSD files allow you to save layers. Probably, the most important aspect of Photoshop is the ability to work with non-destructive layers that can be re-visited in the future. Let\\'s say you decide to scroll through your archives, and you find a 2014 photograph saved in PSD format. It\\'s a nice image, but you realize that the purple sky looks a lot like Armageddon (maybe that has happened to me). Since you edited your image using layers and saved the final file using the PSD format, you can open the image and adjust only the necessary layers.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nUncompressed format\\n\\nNon-destructive editing using layers\\n\\nGranular control over your edits\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nLayers can generate an enormous file size\\n\\nThe necessity to use a paid software\\n\\nPNG:\\n\\nYou made it. This is the last of the Mohicans in this thorough comparison between the different image file formats. The PNG file acronym stands for Portable Network Graphics, and it was first introduced in 1995 as an improvement to the GIF format (a file format seldomly used by photographers). This lossless format is the only file type that allows the use of transparency. This particular aspect makes the PNG format the ideal candidate for photographers looking for ways to overlay their logos on top of images.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nUncompressed format\\n\\nAllows working with transparency\\n\\nIt does not require specialized software.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nImage quality not suitable for printing\\n\\nCongratulations\\n\\nYou have finished reading this thorough revision on all the different image file formats. I hope you have enjoyed the reading and learned something new along the way. Honestly, I believe that learning when and how to use those different image file formats helped me during my photography career. This knowledge helped me create my own logo, save and upload images to my website, send images out to magazines and printshops, and ultimately save and store my photography edits.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you – how do you deal with all the different image file formats?

That would mean a lot to me.\\n\\nHave a wonderful day.. Hey guys!\\n\\nGonna go see the meteor shower tonight. I figured I could at least try to take some pictures while I\\'m at it but I\\'ve never done it with I proper DSLR (I had taken a teeny point-and-shoot and aimed it into my telescope to take a picture of the moon. Actually turned out well!) Now I have a D7100 with two lenses (16-80 mm and 35 mm). I\\'m brining my tripod since this is probably gonna involve a really slow shutter speed, but you guys tell me. :P \\n\\nI really appreciate any tips that are shared and thanks so much in advance!\\n\\nUpdate: sorry for the waaaaay late response. It was cloudy/raining for both nights. :( But thank you all so much for your advice and links and such. They\\'re bookmarked and I\\'m taking notes. Hopefully will test it all out sometime in the next few weeks. :). I consider myself an amateur photographer though I\\'ve had a few paying gigs. I\\'ve done mostly family/lifestyle photography and professional headshots for friends on the side. I haven\\'t done headshots for the acting space yet. My nephew asked me to do his to update his Actor\\'s Access profile and for acting school applications. Any advice for styling or what talent reps or casting directors would look for? Suggestions on types of background(s), poses, editing, etc. to do (or to avoid) would be helpful. He\\'s 16 if that makes a difference. Thanks in advance for any tips or tricks!. Hi, for documeting our life (vacation, events, trips,...) I\\'ve been using DSLRs for many years as main camera and moved from a Nikon D7200 to a Fuji XT20 as it being lighter and more compact. As workflow I\\'m downloading everything in Lightroom Classic after which I publish it to a personal \"family\" website.\\n\\nHowever, since this workflow requires time behind my PC and I\\'m quite active with a lot of things going on (including my children) I\\'m often lagging behind, meaning my albums are only published or updated 1 or 2 months after shooting.\\n\\nLately, I became interested in videography as well, documenting activities of the children. As I have my phone (iphone 11pro) with me at all times, most of the filming is done with my phone, and I even do the editing on my phone or sync it to my ipad. This is a quick and easy workflow as I can do both filming and editing wherever I am (not requiring a PC).\\n\\nSo this weekend when we were at the zoo I had my phone and camera (in a sling bag) with me, but I mostly used my phone to record everything, escpecially since you need to be quick with shooting children and you don\\'t need to mess with your camera settings before you can record. I also don\\'t need to go through the hassle of downloading everything as I can edit directly afterwards on my phone (or ipad where everything is synced to).\\n\\nI\\'m still in love with my Fuji and espeically the 35mm 1.4, but I feel I\\'m sliding towards mobile as it\\'s quick and I don\\'t need my PC for editing. \\n\\nIs this also something that you are experiencing, that you tend to use your phone because you always have it with you and it\\'s easy? And also as you can edit your pictures/videos on the fly.\\n\\nOr is this perhaps because I want to do both photo and videography and I\\'m not dedicated enough to immediately upload to my PC when I\\'m home that I\\'m struggling with this?\\n\\nHow are you dealing with this?. I often use a [reversed](http://support.nikonusa.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4618/~/br2-and-br2a-inversion-rings) 50mm lens to capture [wedding](http://i.imgur.com/7GtDS.jpg) [rings](http://i.imgur.com/k7FLA.jpg) when I shoot weddings.  I\\'ve also had a [Nikon PB-6 bellows](http://i.imgur.com/yIUe5.jpg) lying around for a while, but never really messed with it.  I pulled it out yesterday, along with a couple of flashes mounted out in front of my lens, facing each other.  I then discovered how amazingly close one can get with this setup.  All images in this series are uncropped unless otherwise noted.\\n\\n[Close-up on a flower roughly 1\" long and 1/2\" in diameter](http://i.imgur.com/gvhdC.jpg)\\n\\n[EXTREME close up of the same type of flower](http://i.imgur.com/8Rath.jpg) Crazy petal structure!\\n\\n[Alien tentacle porn... no, wait; that\\'s another flower!](http://i.imgur.com/gPlS6.jpg)\\n\\n[Closer...](http://i.imgur.com/HQ5Zi.jpg)\\n\\n[Accidental overexposure, but I like it!](http://i.imgur.com/zTeQ8.jpg)\\n\\n[Moss](http://i.imgur.com/WHWP6.jpg) I thought it was soft and fuzzy, not sharp and leafy!\\n\\n[Pollen on the stamens](http://i.imgur.com/6SrPR.jpg) This flower was roughly 1/4\" in diameter\\n\\n[An inch-long slug says hello](http://i.imgur.com/eDBjM.jpg)  Veins.  VEINS!\\n\\nMy first setup for this involved some [mickey-mousing of superclamps, cross-bars and gooseneck-mounted flash units](http://i.imgur.com/kKlRO.jpg), all attached to a Bogen/Manfrotto tripod.  [Here\\'s how I shot those tentacles](http://i.imgur.com/9APZz.jpg), and [here\\'s how close I had to focus for the moss](http://i.imgur.com/vtFK0.jpg) - less than 1/4\" from the glass.\\n\\nI\\'m headed to Home Depot shortly to manufacture a better [dual-flash bracket](http://i.imgur.com/H5j59.jpg) that I\\'ve been pondering for use with the bellows, and will post the result when it\\'s done.  FYI: what I\\'ve done here can be done with any camera that can use a manual lens.  I\\'m not as familiar with Canon bodies (I\\'m a Nikon shooter), but for Nikon, this means the D70/D70S, D200, D300/D300S, D700, D2 & D3 series, etc.  Now, a number of other Nikon bodies can *use* manual lenses - the meter just doesn\\'t work with them.  You can use a hand-held meter to compensate for this, if you\\'ve got one.  If not, you can use your LCD to guess and check your exposure until you get it right.  If you do this, however, you\\'ll have to use your flash(es) in manual mode as well.\\n\\n**Edits: ** *Updating with additional details and answers for comments:*\\n\\n**Scilaci: ** The camera was a [Nikon D700](http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Digital-SLR/25444/D700.html), with [SB-900](http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Flashes/4807/SB-900-AF-Speedlight.html) and [SB-600](http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/ProductDetail.page?pid=4802) flash units.  The SB-900 was connected to the hotshoe using an [SC-29](http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Flash-Cord/4766/SC-29-TTL-Coiled-Remote-Cord.html) cable, and the SB-900 was used as an iTTL master to trigger the SB-600 wirelessly.  I like the SB-29 (as opposed to the [SB-28](http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Flash-Cord/4765/SC-28-TTL-Coiled-Remote-Cord.html) because the SC-29 has an additional AF-assist projector that mounts on the hotshoe, so it doesn\\'t matter where or how far the flash unit is positioned, nor what light modifiers you might have on the flash unit that may be obscuring the flash\\'s projector.  Of course, this is largely irrelevant for macro, since it\\'s all manual focus.  But it remains true for other work, which is why I had that particular cable handy.\\n\\n**saadakhtar: ** As it happens, my bellows has... well, it isn\\'t a \"preview\" lever; it\\'s more like a \"stop down entirely\" lever, that closes the aperture to it\\'s smallest setting - f/16 for this lens.  However, the two flashes - especially less than 6 inches from the subject - are more than sufficient to handle that aperture setting.\\n\\nI\\'ll definitely agree that moving one\\'s self is definitely the *easiest* way to focus, but I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s the best, and definitely not the most accurate.  My bellows allows me to move the front and back independently, as well as the bellows itself forward and back on the tripod.  (Assuming you\\'re using one.)  Thus, I find that the most accurate way to focus on a stationary subject is to mount the bellows on a tripod, get a bead on my subject, expand the bellows to the magnification I want, then slide the bellows forward or back on its track until the focus point is where I want.  Then I\\'ll press the DOF preview (or whatever) lever, and fire off a shot.\\n\\nFor moving subjects, this just takes WAY too long.  That\\'s when a more mobile solution I mentioned above comes into play.  It\\'s not perfect, but it definitely comes in handy.\\n\\n**wtf___over: ** Here are some samples from the first test of the new rig:\\n\\n[Spider eating dinner](http://imgur.com/T2riC.jpg)\\n\\n[A shedding dandelion](http://imgur.com/mdIWx.jpg)\\n\\n[Close-up of a dandelion\\'s center](http://imgur.com/w8ZiO.jpg)\\n\\n[Playing with the lack of depth-of-field](http://imgur.com/nPQ3O.jpg)\\n\\n[Another tiny (<1/4\") flower](http://imgur.com/MkLTx.jpg)\\n\\n[Budding flowers](http://imgur.com/Mxif4.jpg)\\n\\nA note about \"Budding flowers\": One flash was aimed at the subject, but the other was aimed straight forward (past the subject) to illuminate the wall in the background.  (This was shot at night.)  The focus point isn\\'t really all that great, but I love the way the lighting turned out.  This is one of the benefits of this new rig\\'s design: each flash can be positioned and aimed as desired, giving the rig much greater flexibility.\\n\\n**Update: ** I just built the flash bracket described above, and [here are the details](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/dg85z/diy_in_30_minutes_dualflash_macro_bracket_for_15/).  It\\'s a little awkward (though certainly not as much as yesterday\\'s little expedition), but it works!. I am not a photographer.  \\n\\nPhotography is strictly a hobby for me. In order to not fuck up the happy couple\\'s memories, I would like some advice from the more experienced.\\n\\n\\nMy Gear:\\n\\n* 5D3\\n\\n* 16-35 2.8L\\n\\n* 24-70 II 2.8L\\n\\n* 70-200 II 2.8L\\n\\n* 35 1.4L\\n\\n* 50 1.2L\\n\\n* 100 2.8L\\n\\n* 600EX-RT (x4)\\n\\n* X-PRO1 + 18, 35, 60 lenses\\n\\n* Umbrellas, light stands, portable backdrops, modifiers, diffusers\\n\\n\\nWedding: From what I have been told so far, it will be small and informal. Outdoors in a backyard garden. Evening during summer.\\n\\n\\nThis is a paying event, so I assume that it would be in the best interest to have a contract in place. The couple is going to ask me for my price - what are some pointers? Flat fee + prints or image library? I am not really concerned about earning money, but I don\\'t want to spend any on a bunch of paper if that\\'s what they choose.\\n\\n\\nI know about getting a shot list together.\\n\\n\\n..but what about etiquette? What do you suggest while services are commencing - do I get to roam around where ever, whenever I want? What about flashes during the ceremony?\\n\\n\\n99.99% of the time I shoot in manual mode, it\\'s just where I am comfortable. Do you have a rule-of-thumb for modes?\\n\\n\\nI know the characteristics of my lenses and use them to get the effect that I want. I assume at a wedding I won\\'t have much time to be swapping out lenses quickly enough (and my other Canon body is out of service for the time being), so I will have my X-Pro1 with me as well. Suggestions?\\n\\n\\nI am excited about doing this because I love playing with light and taking pictures -- but what makes me nervous is that this isn\\'t for play - this is their wedding! I\\'m nervous.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n**UPDATE:** I have subtlety tried to get out of it and made it VERY clear that I am not a professional. I was informed that the date has moved and is now about 4 months away. I may actually be on vacation at that time so it may not work out anyway.\\n\\n\\nTHANK YOU ALL for the tips and guidance!! I really appreciate it all. Since I have more time now, I am going to focus on trying to assist as a 2nd shooter and get a little experience.. I\\'m going on a 16 day trip to Asia and won\\'t be taking a laptop with me. Will be traveling by train a lot and not starting anywhere for more than 3 nights, so I plan on taking a lot of pictures and videos. I shoot raw and will be taking my iPhone with me, so I will have Lightroom mobile to do a little work on the train. Does anyone have any experience with things like the RAVPower file hub for this use? Would I be able to use something like this to dump photos off my SD cards to a hdd and use my phone to catalog and edit, then just transfer it back to my computer when I get home? Or is there a better way?. NB: Kinda made this in the heat of the moment; not sure if this breaks any of the rules in /r/photography.

Hey guys, as the question states. I find myself taking less and less photos because I don\\'t want to sit down infront of lightroom and wait the 30-60 minutes to import from a card capable of 80mbs read, and through a reader that easily has the bandwidth. \\n\\nI have a really high end system for gaming, haswell quad running at 4.5ghz, 16gb ram, 1tb of SSD storage and a titan x and lightroom still runs just like it does on my Core M based tablet. Maybe a tiny bit faster. \\n\\nI\\'ve done every performance tweak in the book and if I import about 200 fuji raw files, and start sorting, about 4-5 photos in and the preview will no longer update and just gets stuck at whatever the last image was until I restart. I use spot removal and after the 4-5th removal, it takes about 10 seconds to process the next step. So if someone is pretty pimply, it\\'s a pain.\\n\\nI have these exact same problems on my laptop. Does anyone else experience this on a regular basis? Whats another good program to go with? I am more apt to edit on my iphone then even my desktop now. \\n\\nI\\'m about ready to get the iPad pro, use wifi to trans my photos and do all my editing there.. EDIT: I\\'m not entirely new, have been photographing my products for about 2 years now, I just consider myself a beginner still.\\n\\nOk a little background first. I\\'m mostly wanting to improve my product photos- very nontraditional men\\'s rings/ wedding bands, which I normally shoot against a wood background, if it\\'s important. \\nI\\'ve got plenty of basic experience, but I\\'m looking to step things up.\\n\\nObviously I want to learn both, but have limited time currently, so I\\'m wondering to improve should I start by spending my time learning software better (currently using GIPM) or should I be learning to set up my shots and use my camera better?\\nIf the latter, if someone has any suggestions on learning resources, it would be greatly appreciated!\\nOf course I\\'m open to any suggestions to improve.\\n\\nNot trying to promote anything, but here is my website with my current photos for reference-\\nhttps://richterscalerings.com/\\n. I am shooting with a Nikon d3000. I have a SanDisk Ultra 16 GB SDHC and a Sony 16GB SDHC. The SanDisk has a capacity of ~1300 exposures, the Sony, ~900. I am shooting RAW, with files ~16mb each. Dafuq???\\n\\n**EDIT:**Alright, jerks. I get it. You think the whole saving SD cards is dumb. I just started doing that this fall after talking to a pro photog who does the same thing with his cards. So my \\'collection\\' is 3 cards. My thinking was that they cost very little and take up no space so what is the harm? That said, I wasn\\'t aware of (or at least wasn\\'t thinking about) the possibility of deterioration/failure/etc. of SD cards. Like I said, I have everything on a hard drive, as well. So, when I fill this SanDisk (likely this weekend) I\\'ll reformat and see what it says and then update... I was out shooting some fall colors this morning and, upon editing those photos, discovered a very blurry portion of a shot that I\\'m a bit confused about.\\n\\n[Here are two pictures](http://imgur.com/a/ohQH6). These are SOC except for small exposure adjustments.\\n\\nBoth were shot with a Tokina 11-16 at ISO 125 and 11mm. This lens does not have stabilization, and I\\'m using a D7100 body. I had the camera set on the self timer and used bracketing to take two shots for every shutter release.\\n\\nThe first photo was shot at f/5.6, 1/60 sec on a tripod, focus at 0.71m (according to Darktable). The second photo was shot at f/14.0, 1/30 sec handheld, focus at 2.82m (according to Darktable).\\n\\nOne would expect the first photo to be sharper; I used a faster exposure, a tripod, and an aperture less likely to cause diffraction issues. However, if you look at the first one, the right third of the photo is incredibly blurry, although all the corners are blurry. The hyper-focal distance for 11mm is about 1.07m at f/5.6 and about .45m at f/14; that means I focused a little short of the hyper-focal distance for the first shot, and well past it for the second. Could this make that huge of a difference? Or maybe my camera moved on the tripod? I\\'m not sure if this is a focus issue or a shake/movement issue. I\\'m further puzzled because the second photo, which I handheld, looks so much sharper. Any thoughts?\\n\\n**Edit/Update**: Thanks for all the suggestions, folks! I\\'m going to chalk this up to operator error, both with the focus and (probably) camera shake. I\\'ll have to be more diligent in the future.. So I\\'m a member and instructor at a small-town photoclub, which is fun. Most people have no idea of what anything means just that it works. As an example they know that high ISO lets you have a faster shutterspeed, but not why.\\n\\nIn explaining Aperture, I find it hard to convey what \\'increasing and decreasing aperture\\' actually means. I know that Aperture is a fraction (1/2.8 is larger than 1/8) but thats not what people say. We say f/2.8 and f/8, which makes the unenlightened think that f/8 is larger than f/2.8. And I understand the confusion.\\n\\n\"Increase the aperture from f/8 to f/5.6\" gives a lot of \"Ehh, did you mean \\'decrease\\'?\" comments. And as I don\\'t want to explain what actually is going on, all the time, I was wondering if anyone know how to have people understand?\\n\\nIn short; Were you to ask people to change their aperture from f/8 to f/16, would you tell them to increase/make it higher, or to decrease/make it lower?\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n[UPDATE]: Thanks everyone! I now feel armed to simplify the explanation and convey it! . Hey all,\\n\\nAn exotic auto group based in NJ was very pleased with some photos i took with their Lamborghinis and McLarens after i emailed them a few sample photos. \\n\\nThey responded and asked me what my day rate would be. Now I don\\'t know if I would consider a \\'professional\\' photographer yet and the only time ive been paid to do any shooting was for a family-friends sweet 16. So basically this would be my first legimtimate paid gig. \\n\\nI was wondering what you all would think is a fair day rate for a small-time photographer such as myself\\n\\nIG: @marky.jpeg for anyone interested Welcome to\\n\\n**UPDATE**: I decided on $250/~~hr~~ day negotiable as i thought that was fair \\n\\nMy original post from a couple weeks ago about reaching out to the dealership: https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/6mu9u7/_/. I am trying to get into photography after using a simple point and shoot for years. I have around £400 to spend on a camera and decided on a mirrorless one (mainly due to the size making it easier to carry everywhere) and after spending days and days reading reviews the a6000 seems like the best option.\\n\\nAmazon currently offer £100 cash back so can get the camera and the basic 16-50mm lens for under £400.\\n\\nAs I am just starting out I am not focusing on any particular area of photography so need a good all rounder for going on walks (landscapes, close up of plants/flowers, photos of people) until I start to really find what I like photographing. \\n\\nIs there any reason not to go for it? a5100 is around £80 cheaper but the a6000 reviews seen like the extra is worth the £80.\\n\\nUpdate: My a6000 is getting delivered tomorrow. Thanks for all the help. . so here is my problem.  i went to the beach this weekend took my gear in the early in the morning and took some pics of an early sunrise. that was my main objective and i had a blast walking through the sand and surf.  later on i dropped my gear off in my room because the stuff is heavy and went to eat breakfast on the diner downstairs.  the diner was empty and overlookin the beach had huge windows allowing alot of badass morning light.  it was illuminating this table and chair nicely with my cup of coffee with the beach as a backdrop.  i really wanted to take some pics.  so thats my dilemma lately i find inspiration at times when i dont have my dslr.  i really like using lightroom and should i try and get a point and shoot to carry with me at all times?  an iphone?  i really dont like iphones and instagram because everyone seems to be doing that but i would like the capability of a pocket dslr if something like that exists.\\n\\n*update*  \\ni went with a panasonic LX7 @ amazon for $328.  I was at a best buy store and was almost about to buy the sony rx100.  its really sleak, streamlined, functions worked great, it just felt right up until the $650 tag...   i understand that it has a new huge sensor on it but it just doesnt make sense that it costs as much as my d5100.  i dont want to replace my dslr just need something to augment my photography needs and the price of the LX-7 with its features and 1.4 max aperture seem worth it.  yea it has a small sensor but i only hope to use it for candid shots nothing in demanding light settings.  anywho it seems like a win all these compacts in this category seem to be going for $600+.  hope i made a good choice.. Hello all. I need to order a new wide angle lens ASAP. I will be working for a company that needs pictures of neighborhoods (housing, pool areas, gardens) and I am considering a wide angle to capture a majority of the space in one shot. These will be taken during the day, probably in sunny weather. \\n\\nI also need a lens for car photography. I am conflicted because I know the Tokina will be better for landscape due to it\\'s 11-16mm capability, but the Canon will be better for car photography and I have more of a variety of shots I can take with the 17-40mm. \\n\\nI am running a T3i. I am unsure if the Canon will work with my camera, but I know the Tokina will.\\n\\ntl;dr: Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8 OR Canon 17-40mm f/4L for my T3i\\n\\n\\n\\n*Update* I ordered the Tokina 11-16. Should be here next week. Thanks everyone! .

[I made a post on /r/cameras and didn\\'t get many responses...](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/1c0etw/need_suggestions_for_lenses/)\\n\\nUpdate: \\nhere are some more clarifications...\\nI work at a research institution so I usually cover academic conferences that go on in dimly lit low light auditoriums. Often times, I need a tele to get someone talking at the podium/stage so I should have specified that I\\'m looking for a tele. The main reason why I kept the question vague was to see if anybody had a suggestion that I haven\\'t thought/heard of such as the 24-105 being really sharp and versatile (I\\'ve heard this before, just wanted to see what the consensus on /r/photography was).\\nWhat I was kind of looking for in the responses were thoughts and experiences on the 70-200s or alternatives like the first comment on this thread.\\nI also just sold my Sigma 30mm 1.4 and Canon 28-135 because I knew the Sigma 30mm wouldn\\'t work on my 5D and because I found it to be pretty soft overall. In addition, I never used the 28-135 that came with my 7D and I used it a 6D a couple of times and found that 28mm wasn\\'t wide enough for me even on a full frame so I sold that one too.\\nBut to try to expand on my gear reasoning more, I plan to use the 7D with the Tokina 11-16 and the 50mm or tele lens that I\\'m about to purchase with my mark iii. So I\\'m basically looking to have a alternative 16-35 & 70-200 combo, which I read is the golden combination. TL;DR- just skip to the conclusions at the bottom.\\n\\nI had an urge to do some mindless data-gathering, and I\\'m out of projects that involve much of that, so I decided to waste some time on quantifying a pointless question. Yes, I already know it\\'s pointless, there\\'s no need to point it out. If anyone has any ideas on how I can take it further, though, I still need a distraction.\\n\\nPerceptions of cost and value are often skewed. It\\'s not just a camera gear thing, people are just bad at judging these things. All sorts of cognitive biases come into play. A lot of times assertions about what system is cheap or expensive get repeated uncritically. One such assertation lately is that the lenses for the Canon RF system are disproportionately expensive. I\\'m testing this one, rather than other similar such assertations, because it was easier to do than others and because, anecdotally, I\\'ve seen this one be particularly emotionally loaded.\\n\\nMETHOD\\n\\nI compared the cost of all Canon EF lenses currently offered on the US website to all Canon RF lenses currently offered on the US website, as of November 24, 2020. This includes all lenses listed, even if they\\'re on pre-order or back-order. This does not Include EF-M, EF-S, TS-E, or MP-E lenses. All prices are the current prices, making this probably not the best time to do this, but sorting between what\\'s a current sale and what\\'s a perpetual \"offer\" was going to be a pain in the ass, maybe it would be worth re-doing around February when prices stabilize. This yielded 17 RF lenses and 43 EF lenses.\\n\\nI did not account for used prices or models not currently offered in Canon\\'s US online store. That would take the question outside whether the RF system in particular is expensive compared to the EF system, and would instead be a better measure of the cost advantage of older systems, which is too obvious to be of much interest. I am also not accounting for selection and variety within any given price category- broader selection and more variety are, again, well known advantages of most older lens systems.\\n\\nWhen doing one-to-one comparisons between EF and RF lenses, I allowed for minor differences in focal length (20% or so on zooms, not relevant on any current RF primes) and aperture (less than a stop). I mostly stuck to the most basic, objective qualities of the lens, disregarding ergonomics and aesthetics completely, and only considering sharpness, autofocus, and other less straightforward comparisons when I either knew them to be significant or believed there might be objections on the basis that those factors weren\\'t considered. If there are significant, specific distinctions in these regards that I failed to account for, let me know. I disregarded marketing terms in the designation- such as \"L\" and \"macro\"- but did account for differences in what the lens *does* that may be indicated by these. I also didn\\'t account for *how* the lenses accomplish what they accomplish when determining near comparisons, though in some cases considered it when looking at causes of cost differences. I will further leave it as given that the RF lenses have a control ring as part of the advantages of being part of the RF system.\\n\\nBIG PICTURE\\n\\nComparing the EF system to the RF system as a whole gives us a good \"big picture\" test of the cost of the two systems. The 17 EF lenses had an average price of 1602.23USD. The 43 EF lenses had an average price of 2551.07USD, making the average RF lens 37.2% cheaper than the average EF lens. The high average price of the EF lenses is largely due to fast long tele primes, all of which are over 5000USD. Since the RF system doesn\\'t yet have any lenses in this category or this price range, it may perhaps be more informative to exclude these from the EF average. That would yield an average EF lens price of 1222.30, making the average RF lens about 31.1% more expensive than the average EF lens, but this doesn\\'t account for other lenses in each system that don\\'t have a counterpart in the other. In order to make a completely fair comparison, it may be better to compare individual lenses, as I did in the next session.\\n\\nComplaints about the RF lens system are often phrased more in regards to a perceived lack of cheap lenses. While \"cheap\" is certainly subjective, we can break each system down into rough price categories. These categories are admittedly arbitrary, but are based on numbers and ranges often used, in an attempt to reflect perceived pricing. A simple arithmatic scale would be far too granular for the range here, a log10 scale far too coarse. A log2 scale might make sense, and would fall in line roughly with human perception of scale in other categories, but I\\'m proposing the following scale as a better reflection of rough market categories for new full-frame lenses:\\n\\nUnder 200USD\\n200-500USD\\n500-1,000USD\\n1,000-2,000USD\\n2,000-3,000USD\\nOver 3,000USD\\n\\nThe RF system has one lens under 200USD, comprising about 5.9% of the system, while the EF system has three, comprising about 7% of the system. While these numbers are comparable, it should be noted that the RF system\\'s one example has only recently been officially announced, and hasn\\'t event shipped yet, so will likely not have much influence on consumer\\'s perceptions yet, but will be more relevant as we round out the year. \\n\\nIn the 200-500USD price category, the RF system has two examples, comprising 11.8% of the system, and the EF system has three, comprising 7% of the system, a significant advantage to the RF system. \\n\\nIn the 500-1,000USD price category, the RF system has 4 lenses, comprising 23.5% of the system, and the EF system has 9 lenses comprising 20.1% of the system, again the two systems are comparable. \\n\\nIn the 1,000-2,000USD range, has 7 lenses, comprising 11.8% of the system, and the EF system has 15 lenses, comprising 35% of the system, with the EF system having significantly more lenses in this price range. \\n\\nIn the 2,000-3,000USD price range, the RF system has 8 lenses, comprising 47.1% of the system, while the EF system has 6 lenses comprising 14% of the system, with RF having significantly more lenses in this category. This is probably the disparately that contributes most to the perception the RF is an inherently expensive category. 2000USD is a significant psychological barrier, and it probably doesn\\'t help that many of the RF lenses in this category are replacements for EF lenses in the 1000-2000USD category. Regardless of the actual difference in price, difference between a \"1\" and a \"2\" in the thousands place has a significant psychological impact.\\n\\nThe RF system, as already discussed, has no lenses over 3,000USD. The EF system has 7, comprising 16% of the system. As these are all very specialized low-production lenses, this category probably doesn\\'t have much of an impact on consumer\\'s perception of the cost of the system. Since not many people are rushing out to snag a 600mm f/4, not many people think much about it costing 13k.\\n\\nOverall, the RF system has 5.9% of its lenses under 200USD compared to the EF system\\'s 7%; the RF system has 17.7% of its lenses under 500USD compared to the EF system\\'s 14%; the RF system has 41.2% of its lenses under 1,000USD compared to the EF system\\'s 34.1%. In most of these categories, the RF system has a larger proportion of its lenses under most of these cutoffs. The only cutoff where the EF system has an advantage, the difference is marginal.\\n\\nINDIVIDUAL COMPARISONS\\n\\nDifferences in cost between systems are often described as a \"tax\" (e.g. \"Fuji tax\", \"RF tax\", etcetera), implying that the extra cost isn\\'t justified, is merely a function of being a part of the system. While there may be reasons for the higher cost to the consumer- increased production costs for new lines, paying off R&D costs for a new system, marketing concerns- the perception of these price differences being a \"tax\" is based mostly in whether this increased cost is reflected in increased value to the consumer. The best way to judge the validity of this perception is to compare lenses in the \"expensive\" system to near counterparts in another system. This isn\\'t always possible, but is relatively simple in regards to the RF system. \\n\\nMost of the RF lenses have a close counterpart in the EF system. There are nine that have a definite counterpart according to the standards described in the method, four more that have something broadly similar, but just outside of the standards described in the method, and four that have no counterpart.\\n\\nThe RF 50mm 1.8 STM is, as far as can be determined of an unreleased lens, functionally interchangeable with the EF 50mm 1.8 STM. Early reviews suggest the RF model may have a slight advantage in sharpness, but even if this bears out, it\\'s still only an incremental update. The approximately 58.7% cost increase for the RF model is largely not accounted for in terms of increased value to the consumer. It may be notable that this is in line with similar lenses in other mirrorless systems, such as the Sony FE 50mm F/1.8. It is notable that part of the reason for 50mm lenses typically being so cheap is the ease of designing a lens of a focal length close to its backfocus distance, and the RF system has a flange distance much shorter than 50mm, requiring a lot of dead space in the back of the lens to keep the same simple designs. While this may explain why the cost increase exists, it doesn\\'t make it due to a significant advantage to the consumer, as those few millimeters will rarely be critical.\\n\\nThe RF 24-105 f/4-7.1 IS STM is a fair comparison to the EF 24-105 f/3.5-5.6 IS STM. Both are sufficient, but not excellent, optically. The RF model is 1/3 stop slower in the wide end, and 2/3 stop slower in the long end, but also a few ounces lighter. While the EF model has slight advantages, the RF model is significantly cheaper- approximately 33.3%.\\n\\nThe RF 35mm f.1.8 macro IS STM is a fair comparison to the EF 35mm f/2 IS USM. While they use different EF systems, the differences in performance are situational. The RRF model is 1/3 stop faster, and has a better close focusing distance. Despite the slight advantages in favor of the RF model, it\\'s significantly cheaper- approximately 25.2%.\\n\\nThe RF 24-240 f/4-6.3 IS STM is a fair comparison to the EF 28-300mm f/3.5-5.6 L IS USM. Both are sufficient, but not excellent, optically- which is about all it\\'s fair to expect from a super zoom. The RF model is about 14.3% wider in the wide end, and about 20% wider in the long end- whether this is an advantage or a disadvantage is situational, but it isn\\'t significant change the use-case of the lens, and both are about the same zoom range. The RF model is also 1/3 stop slower at both ends. AF is difficult to compare without doing a side-by-side (there aren\\'t a lot of reviews for a sixteen year old niche lens on RF bodies), but both are usually reviewed as sufficient for most purposes. The RF model is far lighter and more compact, but is not compatible with teleconverters. Each lens has its advantages, but the RF model is 71.5% cheaper. Large zoom ratios are an area where the design flexibility of a short flange distance and modern digital corrections provide a significant advantage in cost. Since this is a category that isn\\'t very popular with enthusiasts (more with certain very specific professional niches and with the broad consumer market, but not with the type of people who spend a lot of time talking about cameras on the internet), this doesn\\'t likely influence many people\\'s perception of the cost of the system as a whole.\\n\\nThe RF 24-105 f/4 L IS USM is a very close comparison to the EF 24-105mm f/4L IS II USM. They are also currently the exact same price.\\n\\nThe RF 70-200 f/4L IS USM is a very close comparison to the EF 70-200mm f/4 L IS II USM. The RF model is significantly lighter and more compact, at the cost of tele-extender compatibility and an extending front end. The RF model is approximately 23.1% more expensive. This might be justifiable to some if space and weight are at a premium, but it\\'s quite a bit more than one would expect from a marginal update, especially from a previous model only two years old.\\n\\nThe RF 50mm f/1.2 L USM is a fair comparison to the EF 50mm f/1.2 L USM. The RF model improves upon the older EF model\\'s slow (compared to modern alternatives) autofocus and poor wide-open performance. The value of these improvements are definitely subjective, but the 57.2% price increase is probably hard to justify for most people who don\\'t have a financial stake in high performance wider than the f/1.8 or so that the EF model starts to tidy up at.\\n\\nRF 70-200 f/2.8 L IS USM is a very close comparison to the EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS III USM. The RF model is significantly lighter and more compact, at the cost of tele-extender compatibility and an extending front end. The RF model is approximately 23.8% more expensive. This might be justifiable to some if space and weight are at a premium, but it\\'s quite a bit more than one would expect from a marginal update, especially from a previous model only two years old.\\n\\nThe RF 85mm f/1.2 L USM is a very close comparison to the EF 85mm f/1.2 L II USM. The RF model improves upon the older EF model\\'s slow (compared to modern alternatives) autofocus and poor wide-open performance. The value of these improvements are definitely subjective, but the approximately 30.0% price increase is significant, and may not be justifiable for most people who don\\'t have a financial stake in high performance wider than the f/1.8 or so that the EF model starts to tidy up at.\\n\\nWhich of these are \"worth it\" is highly subjective. Out of the nine examples with close counterparts, though, three of the RF models are significantly cheaper than their EF counterpart. One, and probably the one most similar to its EF counterpart, is the same price. Four more (the 50mm 1.2, 85mm 1.2, and the two 70-200s) are significantly more expensive than their EF counterparts, but provide some advantage that may be relevant to some users. One (the 50mm 1.8) is significantly more expensive at no apparent advantage to the user, except those that come from being part of the RF system. It may be notable that the RF lenses that are cheaper than their EF counterparts are among the cheapest in the system, and those that are of debatable or situational additional value are in categories that typically come at a premium. One could nearly draw the generalization that cheap lenses come at a discount and high-end lenses come at a premium, but the 50mm 1.8 breaks this pattern.\\n\\nIf we compare them as a whole, buying all of the RF lenses in this category would cost 1.5% more than their EF counterparts- a difference probably best considered negligible.\\n\\nRF 85mm f/2 IS STM is debatably a close comparison to the EF 85 f/1.8 USM. The RF model is 1/3 stop slower, but provides a marked improvement in sharpness and contrast at all apertures, a better close focusing distance, and stabilization. These improvements, while significant, also come at a significant additional cost- approximately 42.9%.\\n\\nThe RF 15-35 f.2.8 L IS USM is debatably a close comparison to the EF 16-35 f/2.8 L III USM. The RF model is about 6.3% wider at the wide end, and offers IS- a handy feature for lenses in this category, and previously more typical in f/4 options. It\\'s only about 4.5% more expensive than its EF counterpart, which is surprisingly low for such a significant additional feature, probably due to the relative ease of designing wide lenses for short flange distances.\\n\\nThe RF 24-70 f/2.8 L IS USM is debatably a close comparison to the EF 24-70mm f/2.8 L II USM. Whether the addition of IS is significant for a lens of this category is largely situational, but it\\'s typically one with a cost associated with it. The RF model is 15.8% more expensive than its EF counterpart.\\n\\nThe RF 100-500 f/4.5-7.1 IS USM is debatably a close comparison to the EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 L IS II USM. The extra 25% increase in reach and zoom ratio is significant, especially for a lens of this category. The 2/3 stop slower aperture in the long end is in order with the extra reach, and the aperture is comparable at other focal lengths. This extra reach costs you and additional 12.5% over its EF counterpart.\\n\\nOf these four lenses with a debatable comparison in the EF system, the RF lens was more expensive in every case, but also provided some meaningful advantage in every case. One lens, the RF 15-35, can probably be best described as \"marginally\" more expensive than its EF counterpart, despite the advantages being fair to call significant. The 24-70 and 100-500 come at a more significant premium, but only slightly more than what can be expected from a mere sequential update for unusual combinations of features. The 85mm comes at a premium second only to the 50mm 1.8 discussed previously, though this premium is associated with improvements in the RF lens.\\n\\nIf we add these four lenses to each of our previous baskets, the RF lenses would now be 3.6% more expensive than their EF counterparts, still probably best considered negligible.\\n\\nThe remaining four RF lenses have no counterpart in the EF system. Two- the RF 85mm f/1.2 L USM DS and the RF 28-70 f/2 L USM are also the two most expensive lenses in the system, and probably best regarded as exotic, with very few counterparts in any system. Lenses with apodization filters produce an effect similar to DS, but are typically much slower, except for one example from Fuji, which is for a smaller format. Other standard zooms faster than f/2.8 are mostly for smaller formats and typically have far smaller zoom ratios. The other two- the RF 600mm f/11 IS STM and the RF 800mm f/11 IS STM- are, contrarily, more limited than the most similar lenses. They\\'re multiple stops slower than other current lenses of the same focal length, but set a new low barrier to entry for photographers looking for those focal lengths with automatic focus in terms of both cost and weight- the much faster EF counterparts in these focal lengths weigh several pounds and each cost 12,999USD. Whether any of these are \"worth it\" is highly subjective, but it\\'s best considered a wash on whether these more unusual lenses are, as a category, relatively expensive or relatively cheap.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\n\\nWhen compared to lenses currently offered new in the EF system, the RF system is in most ways comparable to or cheaper than the EF system. The mean lens price is lower in the RF system, unless the most expensive lenses are excluded from the EF system. Proportionately, the RF system has a larger percentage of its lenses in lower price brackets than the EF system, except the very lowest bracket where there is a marginal cost advantage to the EF system. Finally, when comparing individual lenses, the RF lens is often cheaper (sometimes far cheaper) than its EF counterpart, and when the RF lens is more expensive there is usually a significant difference in features or performance, with one notable exception. At least relative to current EF lens offerings, it is therefore best to conclude that the RF system lenses are not disproportionately expensive.. With more devices/websites supporting wider colour spaces, will you consider switching from producing photos in sRGB to wider colour spaces i.e. AdobeRGB/DCI-P3?\\n\\n[https://wccftech.com/galaxy-s10-display-specs/](https://wccftech.com/galaxy-s10-display-specs/)\\n\\n[https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/wide-color-photos-are-coming-to-android.html](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/wide-color-photos-are-coming-to-android.html)\\n\\n[https://www.knowyourmobile.com/news/google-pixel-4-camera-to-feature-wide-color-capture-support/](https://www.knowyourmobile.com/news/google-pixel-4-camera-to-feature-wide-color-capture-support/)\\n\\n[https://www.slrlounge.com/new-photo-resolutions-up-to-5k-more-flickr-updates/](https://www.slrlounge.com/new-photo-resolutions-up-to-5k-more-flickr-updates/)\\n\\n[https://www.dpreview.com/news/2410447162/500px-adds-support-for-wide-gamut-color-profiles-and-google-webp-format](https://www.dpreview.com/news/2410447162/500px-adds-support-for-wide-gamut-color-profiles-and-google-webp-format)\\n\\n[https://www.diyphotography.net/instagram-breaking-srgb-introduce-wide-colour-display-iphones/](https://www.diyphotography.net/instagram-breaking-srgb-introduce-wide-colour-display-iphones/). Hello everyone!\\n\\nI discovered a workaround to offload RAW images( RAF for fujifilm shooters) from my camera\\'s SD card on to a portable hard drive, and then be able reload them on to my iPad for raw editing on Lightroom CC as I wish.\\n\\nWhat I needed:\\n\\n1. iOS device: 2017 iPad Pro 10.5 256gb.\\n2. Apple Lightning to SD Adapter.\\n3. RavPower WD03\\n4. 32gb SD Card from Camera\\n5. 1TB SanDIsk Portable Extreme SSD\\n\\nSo why did I want to do this?\\n \\nI currently have an early 2011 MacBook Pro that is still performing strong, however, it is quite bulky to bring around. I am also in limbo with my photography hobby/career. I don’t do enough photography for weddings or events that require me to batch edit hundreds of images in one sitting. I can always fall back to my MacBook if a gig like that calls again. Anyways, street photography and portraits are the shit, - always was and always will be for me. I couldn’t justify buying a new MacBook Pro ($2.6k-$3.6k range) or even a new MacBook Air ($1.5k) for the type of work that I do now. For the record, I got my iPad Pro for $549,  Apple Lightning to SD adapter for $30,  RavPower, 1TB Sandisk SDD for $250. You do the math.\\n\\n When I do travel, I never bring my MacBook Pro. That shit is heavy as fuck… 5.6lbs.  If I were to, it would only be used to backup data to my portable drive, some editing/culling and using the internet when my bank sends me travel authorization warnings, - which I can already do on my iPhone/iPad.\\nSo yeah, it doesn’t make sense to me. The iPad is a perfect travel companion for this method. I also just wanted to discard shit photos that don’t spark me joy before it reaches the cloud/MacBook Pro at home. The Magic of Tidying Up, baby! As for Lightroom CC sync, it’s so slow with the RAW/RAF files, and I can’t always rely on it if the internet sucks where I stay.\\n\\nAs for my iPhone XR? Aside from a smaller screen than the iPad, I can actually do this back-up method on it, too, but the offloading/loading FUJI RAF files requires a bit of patience. 10-20mb image files over LAN/WiFi via RavPower is slower than your average USB 3.0. I want to be able to have the luxury to leave the iPad backing up on the table, while I go lay in the hotel bed with my iPhone-YouTube-Instagram-distracted-girlfriend. I would want to use my iPhone when this happens. Kidding aside, I just don’t want to be tethered to my RavPower and external hard drive during uploads while we step out of the hotel room and actually enjoy our trip. The iPad can do that.  Also, I’d feel naked without my iPhone in the real world.\\n\\n\\nSo what’s my workflow? I’ll give you the semi- tl;dr.\\n\\n\\t1. Shoot Photos on Fuji Camera as RAW+JPEG -> Use RavPower and FileHub app to copy SD Card to 1TB portable hard drive SSD\\n\\t2. Feel Inspired to Edit -> Slip a blank SD Card into the RavPower, open it up and create the following subfolder order: DCIM/666_FUJI/ (or if you’re religious, any 3 digit number in replacement of “666” should work) and then copy your RAW+JPEG files from the external hard drive back into the 666_FUJI folder. \\n\\t3. Take SD Card and shove it up the Lightning to SD reader and into your iOS device. If you follow this correctly, the Photos app should detect it. Import as you like. If it doesn’t work, then you can just take the SD Card back into your camera, take 1 photo and then re-copy the external drive photos into the new DCIM folder.\\n\\t4. Lastly, open Lightroom CC, and those recently imported images should reflect as RAW. \\n\\n\\nThings I can’t do:\\nOnce I import the images into the iPad/Lightroom, I can’t locally bring the edited RAW files back to the SD card or external hard drive, - you’ll need Creative Cloud sync for that. I figured if I only load the images I am proud about, I should minimize my data hoarding. \\n\\nI also don’t know the exact folder names for other camera brands, since I only shoot Fuji. \\n\\nAnyways, I hope this helps. If anyone has a better solution, I’d love to know, (a******). <3 Peace!\\n\\n(Update: to reformat a blank SD card, you should always take a photo with your camera to generate the folder. I think my step 2 is not consistent for each use.) . http://www.flickr.com/photos/jubbing/13018361445/\\n\\nFor a little phone, the results are surprisingly good. The total image file size as I uploaded it to Flickr is 59mb, when a normal 38 MP file is 10mb. Had to up some settings because the white Marble on the Taj reflects the sun. A lot. So it\\'s tough for a camera phone to capture it all, but it did well!\\n\\nThe Taj Mahal is beautiful, and I hadn\\'t been in nearly 16 years since I was a kid, but it was well worth the memories again. . My desktop recently got a round of Windows 10 updates earlier this week that caused LR to crash whenever I switched to the develop module. If LR opened in the develop module it would run fine until I needed to select a different directory (external hard drive) or a new catalog. Previously, LR had been working fine with my hardware for months without issue. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nDisabling GPU acceleration did fix the crashing, but it made rendering images when zooming in and out slower and slowed down exporting files too. Plus I knew my GPU should work with Lightroom since it had been fine since I built my computer, so this pissed me off a little.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAfter uninstalling the Windows 10 updates without any success, I decided to take a look a the driver settings in the device manager and rolled back the driver for my graphics card. This seems to have fixed my issue for now; It has been running for a few hours without crashing once, whereas previously it would crash each time I went to the develop tab.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\nI spent several days trying to figure this out, so hopefully this helps people save some time and get the best performance in Lightroom.\\n\\n\\nNinja Edit: Computer Specs \\n\\nGPU - RX 480 8gb\\n\\nCPU - 6600k\\n\\n16 GB RAM\\n\\n\\n. I started using Adobe Lightroom and was happy with it. Then I took a college class and we got a deal/were required to use capture one. It was a weird learning curve but I’ve found my work flow is a lot faster because of the ability to quickly sift through raw files and convert to editable files without lag. I have the Adobe suite subscription from school with better iPhone editing apps and captureone was a “one time purchase” despite the need for updates that cost money. Curious if anyone else is in the same boat trying to decide what to stick with?. Beware, wall of text below.  Scroll to bottom for TL;DR\\n\\nYesterday I posted the [preliminary results](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/2d41zt/exmor_vs_dualiso_preview/) of my comparison between the MagicLantern DualISO module for the 5D3 and the Sony A7.  I\\'ve been using DualISO for quite a while now and I knew that it greatly improved the usable dynamic range of the 5D3, but wasn\\'t sure how it compared to an Exmor sensor.  There\\'s no real comparison that I could find online so I bought an A7 and started doing the comparison myself.  My initial results showed that with a 5 stop push, the two are much closer than I had expected.  \\n\\n[Initial Comparison](http://i.imgur.com/yNClqun.jpg)\\n\\nThe 5D3, left, shows a bit more noise and less detail but actually maintains more accurate colors than the A7 which seems to desaturate the shadows significantly.  But compared to the difference between a vanilla 5D3 and the A7 and this becomes a pretty amazing result.\\n\\nI took both cameras hiking this morning to get some more real world type pictures as well as to show one of the weaknesses that I know still exists with DualISO.  For all of the following pictures I metered so that the highlights were just clipping (based on the A7 zebras) and then dialed it down 1/3rd a stop.  ISO, aperture, and shutter speed are identical for each scene, although the light was changing quite a bit so not all shots are exposed identically but I\\'d say they\\'re all within 1/3rd stop.  For the first shot I was using a 40mm STM on the 5D3 and a 16-35 F4 IS on the A7 (made the weight distribution fairly even and meant I didn\\'t have to constantly swap lenses), while on the last shot I used the 16-35 at 16mm for both cameras.  Both shots were done at ISO 100 while the secondary ISO for the DualISO shots was 1600 for the first shot and 3200 for the last shot were I wanted to show a specific type of artifacting that can occur.\\n\\nThe first is a tree that had a nice dark shadow down the middle from a branch hanging just right with a bright blue sky in the background.\\n\\n[Full Tree SOOC](http://imgur.com/YSDXNvX)\\n\\nZooming in we can see that the shadow from the branch is almost completely black near the branch and then gradually lightens a bit.\\n\\n[Branch SOOC](http://imgur.com/olGOKQV)\\n\\nFirst, comparing the vanilla 5D3 and A7 I pushed the exposure by 2 stops and set the shadows slider to +100 in Lightroom.\\n\\n[5D3 Vanilla vs A7 Exposue +2/Shadows +100](http://i.imgur.com/1cccrUx.jpg)\\n\\nWe can already see that the vanilla 5D3 is falling apart in the shadows with tons of color noise and mush for detail in the particularly dark regions while the A7 still looks fine.  This was were the overall exposure looked fine but I decided to push two more stops just to see how the A7 did.\\n\\n[5D3 Vanilla vs A7 Exposue +4/Shadows +100](http://i.imgur.com/5kSC6gQ.jpg)\\n\\nBy this point the 5D3 shadows are unuseable garbage but the A7 is still looking respectable, very impressive and this is the primary reason why landscape photographers have been ditching Canon for Nikon over the past two years.  Well that and the 14-24.  And 36MP, but I digress.\\n\\nSo now that we\\'ve shown the A7 rules and vanilla 5D3 drools, how did magic lantern do?  Again, we start off with +2 stop exposure and +100 shadows.\\n\\n[5D3 Dual Iso vs A7 Exposue +2/Shadows +100](http://i.imgur.com/eFjyzXg.jpg)\\n\\nWhoa, huge difference compared to the vanilla 5D3.  At this point I\\'ll say the DualISO 5D3 and A7 are doing equally well, but what happens if we push another stop?\\n\\n[5D3 Dual Iso vs A7 Exposue +3/Shadows +100](http://i.imgur.com/c9aaLWb.jpg)\\n\\nThe two are still very close but I think the noise in the A7 has a slightly higher quality to it, still extremely close but I\\'ll give it to the A7 at this point.  How about one more stop.\\n\\n[5D3 Dual Iso vs A7 Exposue +4/Shadows +100](http://i.imgur.com/4b1cedX.jpg)\\n\\nAgain, still close but I think the A7 is starting to pull away from the DualISO 5D3 now.  The 5D3 seems a bit more exposed than the A7, probably from the changing light conditions, and the interpolation scheme seems to be showing some flaws at the edges of where the bark becomes washed out.  Conveniently, Lightroom\\'s CA removal tool works extremely well to get rid of these, but they can still show up if you push the files very hard.  A win for the A7, but not by a large margin.  Below, I\\'m showing the dualISO 5D3 next to the vanilla 5D3 to show what an insane difference dualISO makes for the 5D3.\\n\\n[5D3 Dual Iso vs 5D3 Vanilla +4/Shadows +100](http://i.imgur.com/dgpT65e.jpg)\\n\\nThe last thing I want to show is that there is another type of artifacting that can occur in situations where you push the secondary ISO very high, for this example 3200, and you have thin lines (i.e. small branches or wires) running almost parallel to the sensor rows.  On the left hand side of the frame in the shots below you can see a tree with some bare branches sticking out.\\n\\n[Tree branch artifacts full](http://i.imgur.com/uj44YAm.jpg)\\n\\nIf we zoom in, we can see some places where the tree branches seem to vanish and reappear.  This can happen in a very specific scenario where you are :\\n\\n1. Using a very high secondary ISO.  This usually only happens over ISO 3200, and MagicLantern will warn you about using these settings.\\n\\n2. You have a very thin object.  Thin as in less than ~2 pixel in width.\\n\\n3. That thin object is at an angle of less than ~15 degrees to the horizontal row of pixels.\\n\\n[Tree branch artifacts zoom](http://i.imgur.com/e0kLtoq.jpg)\\n\\nIf you run into this scenario you will probably see this issue.  Whether or not you\\'ll see it in a print is another issue entirely. I made a 13x19 print of this exact shot and it\\'s pretty much impossible to see but if you print larger then it could certainly be an issue. Most scenes don\\'t require the secondary ISO to be set any higher than ISO 800 though as you really get diminishing returns for each additional stop of secondary ISO, but in cases where you absolutely need to push higher then be careful.\\n\\nSo who wins?  Clearly the A7.  It\\'s simply the better tool for this kind of shooting.  The workflow is way easier, you don\\'t have to fiddle with installing MagicLantern, turning on DualISO, fiddling with the secondary ISO, or worrying about factors that might leading to artifacting.  Plus it retains resolution better when pushed.  That said, unlike with the vanilla 5D3 where the difference in image quality in these types of adverse situations is enormous, we\\'re really nitpicking minor differences here.  The fact that the guys from MagicLantern have extracted so much extra dynamic range from the Canon sensor is pretty amazing.  Additionally, there\\'s a yet to be released update for magic lantern that adds ~0.8 stops of highlight headroom for the 5D3 just using some of the pixel capacity that Canon decided to keep in reserve for whatever reason (i.e. when the 5D3 sensors clips to white, it\\'s not actually clipped.  There\\'s at least another 0.8 stops available before it really clips.)\\n\\nSo is DualISO great for people who only shoot landscapes and run into DR issues all the time?  I\\'d call it good but not great, if you\\'re this kind of shooter you\\'re crazy for not moving to Nikon or at least picking up an A7R.  Is it great for people who normally shoot lower contrast scenes but get frustrated when they occasionally do run into a DR limited scenario?  Definitely, this is pretty much the category that I fall into and DualISO has pretty much eliminated any temptations to move over to Nikon.\\n\\nPS:  I like the A7 more than I had expected but good lord are the ergonomics horrible.  This is literally the least comfortable camera I\\'ve ever held.  My wife shoots with a Fuji X-T1 and has much smaller hands so the grip doesn\\'t bother her as much, but for me it\\'s like Sony put an absolutely wonderful sensor inside of a torture device for my right hand.  The battery life also seems comically bad.  I was only out hiking for ~2 hours and had charged the camera immediately before leaving.  I kept it on viewfinder only mode and turned it off between uses while taking a total of 16 shots and the battery was at 46% by the end of the hike.  I did use the A7 to determine all of my exposure settings so the viewfinder was active for a while during each shot but I must have something configured wrong with regard to power management as there\\'s no way the battery life could be this bad.  Any suggestions?\\n\\n**TL;DR DualISO allows a 5D3 to do 90% of what an Exmor sensor can do, but shows some artifacts if you try to push shadows more than 5 stops.**\\n\\nEdit:  Added a comparison between the A7 and X-T1.  It does very well for a crop camera and beats the vanilla 5D3, but it\\'s outclassed by the A7 and DualISO 5D3.\\n\\n[X-T1 vs A7](http://i.imgur.com/ZtYVTGs.jpg)\\n\\nEdit: Cleaned up two spots where the language seemed a bit harsh.\\n\\nUpdate:  I went back and made a bunch of 13x19 prints with the examples posted in the article and some that I didn\\'t post and I feel pretty safe in saying that if you\\'re printing at 13x19 or smaller and keep secondary ISO at or below 1600, the A7 has no real advantage over the DualISO 5D3.  When A1ex releases the the ADTG update I\\'ll have to rent a D810 and do another comparison.\\n. Hi all!\\n\\nI’m a commercial and fine art photographer, and I’ve found that the more gear I buy, the less I’m driven to use it. I rarely shoot for fun with my DSLR equipment anymore— I tend to just opt for my film cameras when I’m looking to shoot my personal work.\\n\\nOver time, though, I’ve noticed that some of my best shots are the ones on my phone. Ever since picking up an iPhone X, the telephoto lens and higher image quality has really expanded my creativity while using the device. Since it’s always on me, I’m always shooting— my Instagram has slowly become almost 100% mobile photography, yet I’m still extremely proud of the photos I share and many look very close to my personal work shot on 35mm and medium format cameras.\\n\\nWhen updating my website recently, I decided to include some of my favorite mobile photos— they are some of my strongest images compositionally despite the lower image quality. I’ve printed and sold quite a few of them, and they look great when printed on heavy fine art paper.\\n\\nIs this a problem? I personally don’t care what I’m shooting on— but could it diminish some of my credibility when proposing work for exhibition? Or, am I somewhat paving the way for mobile photography to become fine art? \\n\\nLet me know what you think!. Update and results from the post regarding taking pictures at a wedding with limited gear.\\n\\nGear: \\n\\n* Sony A6000\\n* Minolta 58mm F/1.4 \\n* Rokinon 12mm F/2.0\\n* Sony 16-50mm F/3.5-5.6 \\n* Nikon D3200 \\n* Nikon 55-200mm F/4-5.6\\n\\nI didn\\'t have any external flashes, probably the main thing that would have saved a lot of pictures near the end of the event as British summer time means the sun was bright until like half 8PM. I bounced the flash from the cameras from the ceiling for some of the shots which turned out quite well. I was changing lenses on the Sony body between the kit lens and the Minolta depending on the lighting conditions of the venue I was in.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe event was quite simple and easy to follow as it was just the reception.\\nThe couple got ready in their suite. I scouted around the venue for nice photo locations while the bride was getting ready. I returned and took some photos of the preparation in the suite.\\nWe then went outside to get some couples photos at the venue. Then the guests turned up. Got arrival shots, group shots, a few table shots. Then I just went around getting interaction shots. Then it was the speeches, cake cutting, first dance and dancing for everyone.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nWhen things were slower at the beginning, I used the Minolta for nice sharp portraits. I used the Rokinon for location shots and also one couples shot to get a wide angle view.\\nThen it was just the Sony kit lens and the 55-200mm on the Nikon for almost the rest of the event. The 55-200mm was quite useful for the first dance I didn\\'t want to be too up close to the couple and ruin their moment. The downside was that the pictures came out somewhat dark but RAW post-processing made it fine. For the couples shot at the beginning, two friends of the bride came along and directed their poses and the bride was getting stressed from their direction. I would have liked it more if it was just the couple and me but the shots turned out ok. I took over 1000 photos and ended up with 140. I was using burst mode to get most shots to minimise camera shake so there were many dupes. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIf I was to do it again, I would have invested in an external flash. The 18-105mm F/4 I ordered came late but I\\'d probably use that. (Quite nice lens, good AF, quite sharp near the centre but HORRIBLE distortion which can be fixed with a profile correction. I don\\'t quite have the budget for pro-level lenses with F/2.8 etc) Probably would have taken more time with just the couples photos as we didn\\'t have much time before the guests turned up. Also, I couldn\\'t get pictures of reactions from the bride and the parents during the speeches as I was focused on the speech giver. All in all, the event turned out quite well, learnt a few lessons with post-processing and the couples were very happy with the photos.\\n\\nI\\'ve asked the couple for permission to post the photos here and they said it\\'s ok so here they are: http://imgur.com/a/6v3jX\\n\\n. Hi. I need to replace my aging digital camera which I just use on vacation, etc. (not a professional photographer). \\n\\nThis article seems to say that the iPhone 4S is as good as any other camera. http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/11/can-the-iphone-4s-replace-a-real-digital-camera-for-many-yes/\\n\\nCan I buy an iPhone and just use it as a camera without signing up with a cell phone network? How would I get the pictures off of the camera? Could I connect it to my own wireless network or does it have to be connected to Rogers, AT&T, Apple, etc.? \\n\\nAny comments and guidance would be appreciated.  * My price range is ideally $200-$300.\\n\\nCurrent Camera: I bought a Canon Powershot A430 many years ago but it really doesn\\'t do as well in low light as today\\'s cell phone cameras and the flash often makes things garish. It also uses up batteries really quickly -- as soon as the voltage drops even a bit, it wants new ones. I also have a 35 mm SLR which I haven\\'t used for a few years.\\n\\n------\\n\\n**Update:** Thanks, it seems clear that buying a digital camera is better and I\\'ll note the models that you recommended. (I now will only get an iPhone / iPod touch if I want the cell phone part of it too.  I still have to mull this over a bit.  *Right now we only turn on our Virgin Mobile cell phone every week or two just in case someone has sent us a message. Most people know to use email or our landline.*). (my apologies if this isn\\'t the right place for this sort of post)\\n\\nOver a month ago (September 16) I submitted a copyright complaint through TripAdvisor\\'s process described here: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/copyright_complaint.html\\n\\nThey are definitely aware of the email and the photo, as I have a log of a visitor viewing the photo in question via the TripAdvisor mail server the very next day (September 17).\\n\\nThe photo is posted on my Flickr account with a copyright notice and a date that predates the posting of the TripAdvisor photo by several years.  The TripAdvisor photo has a notice at the bottom that indicates it was gathered through their automated tool: \"Management photo from PhotoCrawler: (posted date)\", which as I\\'ve read elsewhere, seems to be a shady tool for grabbing whatever photos are posted online, then posting them to TripAdvisor without regard to copyright.  Even in the case of Flickr, where the copyright is in an easy and predictable location.  (Are they inviting a class action lawsuit??)\\n\\nI expected this to be a nonissue and a quick resolution, but the photo is still up and I haven\\'t received a reply.  What are the next steps to take, short of hiring a lawyer?  Send another courtesy notice?  Start sending them bills?\\n\\nNov 10 UPDATE: Sent a DMCA takedown, they took down the image about a week later.  No email update like I requested, but they finally did something, so I\\'m happy.. Hello,\\n\\nI\\'ve done a lot of research on this and have only found a few old threads. Basically whenever I post a photo on instagram from my nikon d7100, it appears razor sharp for about 8 hours then the next day the whole image gets blurred on mobile; on desktop it looks fine. I have instagram updated constantly, but keep at ios9 as I hate the new texting features on ios 10 if that makes a difference.\\n\\nHas anyone been experiencing this issue? I have an iphone 5s and transfer my photos from lightroom to the dropbox app (Lr settings exported at regular size with 81 quality). Many say to export your photos to instagrams current dimensions but I was doing that for a while but it never helped. I asked multiple big photographers on Instagram of their technique and most said they simply export full size but have a lower quality around 80. They all use full frame cameras while I use a dx if that matters. But their photos stay sharp forever on mobile somehow while mine still get majorly compressed the next day—it\\'s an ongoing nightmare for me.\\n\\nAny help would be super appreciated! Hope this will help anyone else out as well. \\n\\nMy [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joshuamichaeldiaz/) for reference. . Hi r/photography,\\n\\nI\\'m planning to purchase a wide angle lens for my Nikon D40- I\\'m currently renting a Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 and am enjoying it. I\\'ve decided on a budget of roughly $700 and am open to buying used off Craigslist, Adorama/KEH, FM... I\\'m not upgrading to a new body until next year, and I\\'m still on the fence over whether to go full frame. Having said that, these are the lenses I\\'m considering and the price ranges I have seen on used copies recently:\\n\\n1. Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 (~$300-400 that I\\'ve seen so far)\\n2. Nikkor 10-24mm ($600-700)\\n3. Nikkor 12-24mm f/4 ($500-600)\\n\\nWhat else should I consider? I have yet to find a Tokina 11-16 f/2.8 II (version II having the AF motor, which is important to me now) that meets my budget, which is why it\\'s not on my list. How might I pick between these? I\\'m stuck between the 10-20 (price and performance) and the 12-24 (build and semi-fx compatibility), currently.\\n\\nI know there have been other posts on this (like http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/rpcyv/wide_angle_dx_lenses_decisions_decisions/ , which I read prior to posting. Don\\'t smite me, mods!), but I wanted a thread with updated pricing and my particular situation...\\n\\nETA: So this has become a Tokina 11-16mm lovefest, huh? I mean, the lowlight performance potential certainly is appealing.. So I\\'m beginning to get into recording stuff and posting it on Youtube. I\\'m a 16 year old guitarist who wants to pursue music as a career, so I decided to create a website and post my covers + original work + band work, etc as a digital portfolio. \\n\\nI want all my material to be professional looking - I used to use my dad\\'s old Nikon D5000 (general shot), GoPro Hero 4 (for side shots, closer to the strings) and an iPhone 6s if necessary, mounted to one of those car mounts. \\n\\nHowever my D5000 finally gave up the ghost and I\\'m in search of a new camera (DSLR, mirrorless, camcorder, anything goes) for recording. Hope that you guys can help. \\n\\nMy only main requirements are: \\n\\n* Be able to shoot at least 1080p video (1440p, 2.7k is even better as GoPro supports it, but not really necessary)\\n\\n* Decent battery life - sometimes I sit down for hours at a time and record so the longer I can get the better. \\n\\nIt\\'ll mainly be used in my bedroom next to a window, so fair amount of light, I\\'ll be sitting in a chair to play. The video just has to be at least 1080p. \\n\\nI may also use this for event photography for my school, so being able to produce decent quality pics is a plus. That\\'s sort of why I\\'m mainly looking at DSLRs as opposed to camcorders. I know there\\'s a specific aperture range for event + landscape photography, forgot what it is though, but it\\'ll mainly be low light, some movement on a stage (think dancers, singers, bands, speeches). \\n\\nPrice wise, I\\'m looking to spend a maximum of $400 or so. I\\'m currently considering the Canon EOS 1200D, 1300D, 100D, and Nikon D3300. If there any others I should look at please let me know! \\n\\nI\\'d welcome all input and hope you guys have an idea of what I could get! \\n\\nTL;DR: Could use some help picking out a camera for recording covers + occasionally taking photos! . I\\'m an amateur photographer, and currently I use Lightroom as the centerpiece of my workflow. My dilemma is that I often end up with a long backlog of photos to process. This gets complicated further when I transfer certain photos to my iPhone vis wifi and share them via Instagram or Facebook — since now I have different versions of the same photo in different places, and I have to duplicate the editing for these photos back in Lightroom once I have the RAW files.\\n\\nRight now it feels like my workflow — which relies on processing RAW photos in Lightroom — is overkill, given that I don\\'t make money from my photos. With a few changes, I\\'m wondering if I could simplify things.\\n\\n**I\\'d like to transfer JPEGs to my phone via wifi and do all of my sorting, processing, and publishing directly from the iPhone.**\\n\\n* This would allow me to do most of the work ASAP, instead of letting a backlog develop. I\\'m confident I could get usable final JPEGs using just the camera + phone, but how could I replace Lightroom as a repository and organization tool for all my photos with something from my phone?\\n\\n* Google Photos seems like a reasonable option, but I\\'m scared to move to something that\\'s cloud-only and not necessarily future-proof — having the original local files feels safer. What would I do with the original files if I\\'m using Google Photos? Are there better options? Apple Photos? Lightroom Mobile? Help!\\n\\n**Alternatively, how can I keep my existing workflow but allow for sorting + edits to stay in sync between mobile + desktop?**\\n\\n* Right now, I use VSCOcam on the phone if I\\'m going to post a photo or an album right away (to Instagram or Facebook). But then when I import the RAW files from my camera and JPEGs from my phone into Lightroom, they are treated as separate images, and I have to sort through everything to remember which photos I already published from my phone and try to retrace my steps.\\n\\n* If I could avoid this issue I might be OK keeping my computer-centric workflow, since it still allows in-context editing and sharing without feeling like I have to \"clean up\" the mess later.\\n\\nThank you for helping me think through any potential solutions!\\n\\n**UPDATE** — I\\'ve settled on a solution for now that removes any duplicative work.\\n\\nI transfer all (or almost all) JPEGs directly from my X100T to my iPhone. Then I use Lightroom Mobile to create collections for the keepers. Minor tweaks get made on the phone, and any sharing to social media can be done immediately.\\n\\nOnce in a while, I sit down on the computer to do three things: organize and upload the new collections to Flickr, add any print-worth shots to 500px, and dump all the originals from the phone and SD card onto the computer. \\n\\nOccasionally I backup my library to a second HD that I keep offsite..

I\\'ve never worked with C-stands either so any advice there would be great too.  What about the pocket wizard and the power pack.  How do I get that to work?  I have PW III\\'s for my normal shooting but never used this type before.

Guys,\\n\\nI need to buy a new bag for an upcoming 3 week trip across Europe, I am taking a rolling duffel for clothes and I want a camera bag that doubles as a day pack and a place to keep all my extra stuff. Like a book, a netbook PC or iPad, passport, food, water, possibly a long sleeve shirt and other random personal items. Shit like that, I want it to be my personal bag/carry on that never leaves my side.\\n\\nBut I also want it to hold my d90, a 2nd lens, a flash, and some batteries + memcards. I don\\'t have a big kit now, but i plan on expanding so it would be nice to have some room to grow into and not have to buy another bag in a year.\\n\\n So far it doesn\\'t sound so bad right? Well I have a couple of other nice to haves and it would be awesome if the bag met them all.\\n\\nFirst, I don\\'t want it to look like a camera bag, I am going to be keeping my passport and other personal belongings, i really don\\'t want it to stick out as something people want to steal.  This kinda hurts the standard boxy camera bag / day pack group of bags.\\n\\nSecond, it would be great if I could take the camera in and out of the bag without taking it off my back. I don\\'t really like walking around with a camera around my neck (I know, blasphemy), so it would be great if I could take it out and put it back in the bag quickly without having to stop and put the bag down.\\n\\n3rd, this mother has to last, I travel hard and am brutal with everything I own. I also travel a lot. I want a bag that i can depend on to survive the elements, if i fall or if it gets caught on a branch i don\\'t want the damn thing falling apart.  \\n\\nI am a big guy, 6\"4 220, so a bit of a bigger bag is not a problem, it just cant be so big that I think twice about grabbing it when i walk out the door. I want a bag that I will love.\\n\\n\\nHere are what I have been looking at so far.\\n\\n[Click Elite Obscura](http://www.amazon.com/Clik-Elite-CE611BU-Obscura-Blue/dp/B004TLIJYA)\\n\\n[Kata DR467-i](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003036CTC/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?ie=UTF8&m=A1R58ZKS9HZKXV)\\n\\n[Clik elite Cloudscape](http://www.amazon.com/Clik-Elite-CE612BU-Cloudscape-Blue/dp/B004SN0UQE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1309282194&sr=8-1)\\n\\n[Clik Elite Medium nature pack](http://www.amazon.com/Clik-Elite-CE401GR-Medium-Nature/dp/B0026ZPXAO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1309282194&sr=8-2)\\n\\n[Tamrac 3385 Aero Speed Pack 85](http://www.amazon.com/Tamrac-Speed-Access-Laptop-Backpack/dp/B001L5U16G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1309282307&sr=8-1)\\n\\n[naneu military ops alpha L](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/614819-REG/Naneu_Pro_APL002_Military_Ops_Alpha_L.html)\\n\\nAs you can see nothing really solves everything!\\n\\nThe Military Ops bag is rugged and probably the right size but doesnt have quick access, the Tamrac has the quick access but i just read a post on here that the zippers suck ass, the Clik Obscura is nice but it has a weird camera storage system where the lenses are in the top compartment.

I am currently interning at a newspaper, where my primary role is the \"staff\" photographer/videographer. \\n\\nSince switching from Nikon (with my nice ultra-wide Tokina 11-16) to Canon, I am in need of a good wide-angle lens for my 7D. My primary lens is a 24-105 f/4L, and I follow that up with a 200mm f/2.8 II L for sports. I also have the little 50 1.8 II, which I rarely use. I would really like to add another lens; this time in the wide-angle category.\\n\\nI would like to save up my money and spend a maximum, if possible, around $1000. Here is where I have a few options:\\n\\nI\\'ve read tons of reviews, by far the best wide-angle lens I\\'ve seen is the 16-35 f/2.8L. Now this lens is a pricey piece of glass. Even used, the mkI and II versions are over $1000. The other option for an L lens is the 17-40 f/4, which $-wise is better, but I\\'m stuck with f/4 again, which sucks when I don\\'t want to use my Speedlite and I\\'m indoors. Since the two previous lenses are EF, these would still be used if I upgrade/add a full-frame camera later on down the road.\\n\\nNow, since I use a 7D, I could go for a EF-S/crop-sensor compatible lens. My primary focus is on the oddly-elusive Tokina 11-16 f/2.8 for Canon (why are these so hard to find? Did Tokina go out of business or something?). Used, I\\'ve seen these for about $500, so the price is nice, if I can find one.\\n\\nUsually, this is the avenue I would go. Want to shoot certain types of shots, look at a new lens. However, I\\'ve had another idea: find a used Canon 5D. These are about $1000-ish used, and being full-frame, would allow me to get the nice wide-angle 24mm on my 24-105 lens I already have. Plus, I\\'d have the convenience of a second body. (Sports comes to mind: 7D+200mm &amp; 5D+50mm). \\n\\nSo, what does /r/photography recommend? \\n\\n**TL;DR** Get a 16-35L, 17-40L or Tokina 11-16mm or get a 5D and use the lenses I already have?\\n\\n**UPDATE** Thanks to NowInStock.net, I got an alert that J&R has the Tokina lens in stock. I bought one. Huzzah. Hurry over there if you want one too. My guess is that the supply won\\'t last long.. So I\\'m in the process of finding a new imaging system for an upcoming trip to Europe. Currently, I have an old Sony point and shoot, a Canon video camera, and a Nikon D5000, which I am all willing to sell.  \\n\\nIn return, I\\'m either between a Nikon V1 (purchasing would be awesome, but I might just rent from a place like [this](http://www.lensrentals.com/rent/nikon/cameras/nikon-1-v1)) or 10 cheapo disposable cameras from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-QuickSnap-Single-Camera-10-Pack/dp/B0001BVD1S/ref=sr_1_1?s=photo&ie=UTF8&qid=1346728522&sr=1-1). I once went to Portland with two of these disposable cameras and surprisingly took some of my favorite photographs. Yet the V1 is tempting, especially if there is a way to include that 10mm prime lens.  \\n\\nSo I suppose it\\'s a question of cost and stupidity. I can rent the V1 for 2 months for about $200, buy it for $750 from B&H (if I can sell all my old stuff to reduce the price a couple hundred dollars), or buy 10 27-shot disposables for $40 and processing would be about $60 with cash for CDs and no prints.  \\n\\nMy heart says go with the disposables, but what does /r/photography say?\\n\\n**UPDATE**: wow. fantastic freaking advice. Yes, this was also a late night idea, so I admit, you all bring up some excellent points. I don\\'t want to bring the D5000 with me because it\\'s too bulky, but I at first didn\\'t want to rely only on my iPhone for pics. But I\\'ve decided to bring the iPhone 4s and use it for photo/video, and then 2 disposable cameras in case I feel random and artsy. Someone brought up an excellent point about the restrictions, and I sort of agree with them. I also agree with the fact that the conditions in Portland (the fantastic color palette of greens and browns and beautiful foggy weather) surely enhanced my disposable photos. But we\\'ll see! Perhaps I\\'ll post the results to one of your fantastic sub-subreddits! Thank you for all the advice!. I have a Nikon D7000, and (following much advice on this subreddit) I bought a Tokina ATX-PRO SD 11-16 F2.8 (IF) DX II as my first wide-angle lens last week. I have read that this lens is quite sharp, but my experience so far seems to contradict this: The shots I get using my Nikon 35mm prime seem to be **much** sharper. I shoot in RAW.  \\n\\nWhen I took handheld photos with the Tokina 11-16, the results I got (when previewed in the camera monitor, and later viewed in darktable on my computer) seemed to be noticeably blurry compared to what I have come to expect from the 35mm prime lens. I suspected that this was because of camera shake, so I tested using a tripod, and the blurriness seems to persist. \\n\\nCould you help me with this?\\n\\n* Where can I upload RAW images to share them here? Imgur doesn\\'t seem to support Nikon\\'s NEF format. \\n\\n* Is there something which I need to adjust in the camera or in the D7000 so that it correctly interfaces with the Tokina 11-16? Is it possible that something could be wrong about how the camera \"reads\" the lens? For instance,  when I focus on any object which is farther than a couple of metres the EXIF data for the image always says that the focus distance is 2.82m. Is this how it is supposed to be?\\n\\n* Am I comparing apples and oranges when I compare the 35mm with the 11-16? Is the 11-16 destined to give significantly blurrier images because, say, it has to use the same number of pixels to display a much larger field of view? I do see very sharp pictures online taken by other folks with the 11-16, so I think this is not the case.\\n\\n* I would be grateful for any other advice on this. If I got a bad piece, I have to know so that I can return it!\\n\\nMany thanks in advance for your help.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\n* /u/phidog , /u/Henkeman, and /u/tanstaafl90 , thank you for your help. I will check for front/back focusing problems before worrying more. \\n\\n* I have uploaded two pictures on imgur, [here](http://imgur.com/a/nsh6Z)\\n  \\n  1. In both pictures I focused on the vertical line separating the yellow wall from the red tiled roof. This \"line\" is just the edge of the yellow wall.\\n\\n  2. The first picture is taken with the Tokina 11-16. ISO 100, F/22, 1/4, 11mm. Using a tripod and a timer delay of 2s.\\n\\n  3. The second picture is takend with the 35mm prime. ISO 100, F/11, 1/30, 35mm (duh!). **Handheld** . \\n\\n To me the second picture looks **much** sharper. Am I deceiving myself much?\\n\\n* Apart from the page which /u/tanstaafl90 linked below, I found the following resources which can be used for testing lens micro adjustment:\\n\\n   1. A [tutorial on lens micro adjustment](http://ophrysphotography.co.uk/pages/tutoriallensmicroadjustment.htm), from [this answer](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1hd2r2/ultrawide_angle_lenses_help_me_learn_to_dial_in/cat54jb) on another reddit post. I will try the [interference pattern method](http://www.openphotographyforums.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-4708.html) mentioned in that tutorial. \\n\\n\\n  2. [Jeffrey Friedl\\'s Autofocus Test Chart](http://regex.info/blog/photo-tech/focus-chart), which I found from [this page](http://www.outletphotography.com/nikon-d7000-back-focus-fix/) on fixing Nikon D7000 back focus issues.\\n\\nOnce again, thank you for all the help!! \\n\\n(Meta edit: Can\\'t seem to fix the formatting of the last numbered list, sorry.)\\n  \\n(META: Downvoted to zero? Is this not appropriate for this subreddit?)\\n\\n---\\n**UPDATE:**\\n---\\n\\nI followed the advice of /u/_--_-___-- and did a test with the Tokina 11-16 set to different apertures. I used a poster taped to a wall, and kept the shutter speed faster than 1/100 for all shots. I went all the way from f/2.8 to f/22, and then fixed the aperture at f/8 and took shots for each focus micro-adjustment step available on the D7000 (41 shots for this latter set alone). I took a couple of shots with my 35mm as well, for comparison. I used a tripod and autofocus for all these shots, defocusing using my hand in front of the lens before each shot. \\n\\nResults: *All* the shots with the Tokina turned out to be blurry, with the level of blurriness nearly the same for all the shots: I could not discern much of a difference in the sharpness between any pair of shots, even between the 41 f/8 shots with different micro-focus settings. Many of these shots also showed chromatic aberration effects. In comparison, the shots with the 35mm lens turned out *very* sharp. I have uploaded a crop from one image of each kind [here](http://imgur.com/dUkcuUO,HqmdTGP). The 35mm image was shot at f/1.8, which is supposedly not the aperture at which that lens is the sharpest, and the Tokina 11-16 image was shot at f/8 (where *this* lens is---apparently---not the least sharp). To see the difference in sharpness, blow up each image to fill the screen and take a look at, say, the \"z\". (Apoogies for the scary subject, that was the only poster I could get my hands on!). \\n\\nI did more searching on the web, and found that many others seem to have run up against this blurriness: \\n\\n1. https://www.flickr.com/groups/d7000-club/discuss/72157625411349565/\\n\\n2. https://www.flickr.com/groups/d7000-club/discuss/72157628880261691/\\n\\n3. https://www.flickr.com/groups/638028@N25/discuss/72157622204647961/\\n\\n4. http://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3214135#forum-post-41698720\\n\\nGiven all this, I decided to return the lens and get another one. Thank you all for your help with this!. I have used Snapsort.com & have chosen sony nex 5 camera. Please could you advise if it is a smart choice. \\n\\nI do struggle to find out what lens is better 16-50mm or 18-55mm.\\n\\n16-50mm is a bit smaller but more expensive. Amazon does not provide much detail.\\n\\nI plan to do basic tourism (portrait/landscape) photography.\\n\\n\\n**Updated question:**\\n\\nI plan to go body only. What lens would you get for universal photography (portraits/landscapes). \\nhttp://lenshero.com/lenses/sony-nex-5n-lens\\n\\n\\nThank you \\n. My friend and I just released v2 of our geotagging app PlaceTagger.  It\\'s a HUGE update (completely rewritten) so it\\'s really more like an all new app.\\n\\nPlaceTagger lets you use your iPhone or iPad as a GPS recorder while you take photos with your digital camera.  You can then tag your photos on your iPad or Mac with the GPS data you recorded.  It syncs the data between all your devices using iCloud so it just works.\\n\\nWe\\'re both photographers too and our goal was to create a simple solution for people to tag their photos with gear they were already carrying around instead of spending hundreds of dollars on GPS equipment.\\n\\nThe app is available for [iPhone and iPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/placetagger/id311291645?mt=8) as well as for [Mac OS X](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/placetagger/id519746427?mt=12).\\n\\nI\\'ve posted some promo codes in the comments, please reply if you redeem one.. Hello all, I\\'ve been lurking this subreddit for weeks since I\\'ve actually rediscovered my love for photography. I\\'ve pratically been using my iPhone 4S to shoot for years, and I like it, but I feel like it\\'s time to step up my game, especially considering I\\'m going to Scotland in a few days. A friend gave me her Nikon Coolpix P5000 since she doesn\\'t use it anymore and told me to keep it. I\\'ve toyed with it for a couple weeks but I\\'m kind of unsatistied with its performance (it should also be noted that the viewfinder is broken and the internal battery is dead, so every time I change battery I have to redo the setup completely, which is driving me a little crazy). It has kind of a washed look, it\\'s not really great in IQ (I honestly can\\'t tell the difference from the 4S some times) and lacks features most modern P&S have.\\n\\nSome of the cameras I\\'m looking at are the Sony RX100M1 (around 360€ on Amazon Italy, can\\'t find one used), the Canon S120 (around 290€ on Amazon, around 250€ used) or the Sony A5100 (500€ with 16-50mm kit).\\nI\\'d use it mainly to shoot landscape, portrait, food porn, some macros, and general travel photos. I really like a wide-ish angle and the shallow DoF cliché (am I growing out of it eventually?). All things considered, judging by a bang-for-bucks ratio I think the S120 is the better deal. I\\'ve read bad things about the RX100 (mainly concerning its fragility, ergonomy and battery issue) and the A5100 I\\'ve read bad things about the default lens kit and I\\'m worried about portability.\\n\\nSo my question is: I\\'ve found online a guy near me selling a used (but in good conditions) S120 for 230€ plus a cover and two batteries. Do you think the cost justifies the upgrade from the \\'free\\' P5000? Is any of the other two better in a bung-for-bucks ratio?\\n\\nThanks in advance for all the replies, I\\'m sorry if I\\'m being vague on some aspects, I\\'m not an English speaker and having enough difficulty writing this :D. I was at the Griffith Observatory today in Los Angeles with a married couple.  There\\'s a nice view of the Hollywood sign if you\\'re on top of the observatory.  I\\'ve always known how to get far away landscapes in focus by small aperature (small means big number right?  like f/16 and such).  And when I wanted an object in focus have a high aperature so the background would be blurry.  \\n\\nI felt a little embarassed that I couldn\\'t get them 2 & the Hollywood sign in focus which is right about and to the right of their heads.  They were taking iphone shots with no problem at all lol.  I was pretty confused.  Anybody have thoughts on how to go about getting people & the background in focus especially if they\\'re rather close to you?. 6 months ago, I bought the Zeiss 50mm f/2.0 and I immediately fell in love with it.  It\\'s become my favorite lens; I use my lenses roughly this often:\\n\\n* zeiss 50/2: 80%\\n* canon 35mm 1.4L: 18%\\n* canon 135mm 2.0L: 2%\\n\\nI have a full-frame camera, and I\\'ve enjoyed renting/playing with the 16-35mm f/2.8, but I\\'ve really come to enjoy Zeiss\\' quality, manual focus, etc.  When I occasionally get random strangers to photograph my friends and me, I rely on my Canon 35mm, as it has auto-focus (although, several strangers have actually taken very sharp, in-focus shots w/ my manual-focus zeiss).  It just feels weird getting rid of it, as it offers:\\n\\n* auto-focus, which can be useful at times\\n* f/1.4.  However, I guess I rarely shoot at wider than f2.\\n\\n\\nHas anyone tried the Zeiss 25mm f/2.0; any thoughts on the lens?\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n**update:** I decided to go through with it.  Luckily, B&H had a Zeiss 25/2 in their Used Department, so it was only $1,359 instead of the usual $1,699.  Ordered it yesterday, and I receive it in a few hours :-)   Now I just need to sell my 35/1.4L\\n. Hello!\\n\\nYou might\\'ve seen my post a while back about taking RAW photos with the iPhone 6s and newer where I posted some samples…anyways, since then iOS 10 has been released along with the iPhone 7. So last week I while I was testing an updated version of my app [Reuk](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reuk-camera-manual-controls/id926076143?mt=8) to add support for the 56mm camera I was also testing the regular app and I noticed something that I haven\\'t really seen mentioned anywhere else so I thought I\\'d post it here.\\n\\nWhen using iOS\\'s camera app, if you zoom in to 2x, unless you\\'re in a very well lit place you\\'re not going to be using the \"telephoto\" lens, it\\'s actually going to be using digital zoom from the wide lens. Maybe behind the scenes it\\'s grabbing some data from the other lens, but if you actually cover up that second lens you won\\'t notice any difference in the viewfinder. This really surprised me, I guess it sort of makes sense since the wide lens is f/1.8 and the \"telephoto\" is f/2.8 so that\\'s a lot of difference in light, but I\\'d like to be able to choose a lens manually, so what this means is that to do this you need to use a third party app [like mine or there are several others] that let you do so.\\n\\nThat said, I *love* using the 56mm camera. It\\'s really good, you can check out some sample shots [here](http://instagram.com/ReukCam), everything after the photo of the iPhone 7 Plus till today was taken using the 56mm camera [with my app]. Do you guys have any questions? I\\'d be happy to try and answer any questions you might have!\\n\\n\\nPS. the [beta] portrait mode is pretty neat too, needs a lot of light as well and it\\'s a bit buggy still [obviously] but when it works it can give some really nice results!. Hello all, I\\'m looking for some suggestions on managing my family\\'s photo\\'s and keeping them on our home network.  I\\'ve searched reddit and the google a bunch, but am still not sure where to invest my time driving towards.  \\n\\nI currently have Lightroom 2.7 and Photoshop CS4.  All pictures taken with a digital camera/DSLR over the past ten years are stored (typically in RAW) on my PC\\'s HD, and managed in Lightroom on my PC.  If the wife or other family want pics, I export them to jpg, and send them out. The PC\\'s HD is backed up to my Synology NAS frequently, but no off-site storage.  Often after an event/party, I edit out the best pics, export the, and post them to a google album for everyone to see.  \\n\\nBeing a family with two very small children, most of our pictures are now coming from our cameras (both use iphones now.)  All those pictures are backed up to my NAS using dsphoto, as well as to google/icloud.  \\n\\n\\n**So what I\\'d like:**\\n\\n* Be able to access ALL photos from my PC or a laptop over wifi (me OR the wife)\\n\\n* Organize all photos together (easy enough so that my wife can do it...she\\'s smart, but not super technical)\\n\\n* Allow my wife to create albums and publish, etc.  \\n\\n* Back up NAS to online storage\\n\\n\\n**So here\\'s what I\\'m thinking (but I have some concerns/questions):**\\n\\n* Move all photos (DSLR, iphone, etc) to a standard working directory on the Synology NAS.  (not sure how to transfer pics from iphone to NAS, as dsphoto back-up does it automatically)\\n\\n* Get updated Lightroom, and install it on PC and laptop, point it to mapped network drive.  \\n\\n*  Back NAS up to something like crashplan, etc.  \\n\\n\\n**Questions:**\\n\\n*  I\\'m leery of monthly subscriptions like Lightroom CC, and while I want my files backed up off-site, I\\'m not comfortable with my files being worked on in the cloud (loss of internet, not controlling the files, etc).  I\\'d rather not depend on Adobe not messing up something after a rev bump, etc.\\n\\n*  Is the latest versions of Lightroom easier to use to share and print photos?  \\n\\n* Any better way to do this?\\n\\n\\nThanks, I sincerely appreciate all the input.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n. Ok maybe you guys have all done this ages ago, but I finally sorted this out properly last night. \\n\\nWhenever I finish post on a series, I need to deliver it in various formats; often the same series needs to be made suitable for publication in print, web, and iDevices. Even if it\\'s just portfolio work I want to have it available in those formats so I can put it on my website, email it, and have a portfolio on my iPhone and iPad, and the model agency needs a printable file. \\n\\nI had some Photoshop actions for this but because I kept changing specifications and output folders it was never a one-click process and I always had to spend time figuring out what I was doing. \\n\\nHere\\'s how I streamlined the process:\\n\\nI created fixed folders for each output format. This is so the PS action always knows where to put everything and I don\\'t have to specify new destinations for everything each time. The images get moved to subfolders per series later. The folders are:\\n\\n- print\\n- iPad\\n- iPhone\\n- web\\n\\nThe action does a few things to optimise the files for each destination: \\n\\nFirst, it converts the file to 16 bit (AdobeRGB) if it isn\\'t that already. This is a safety step for the next process, which is flattening the image. In rare occasions flattening an 8 bit file can result in banding and doing this at 16 bit helps to avoid that. \\n\\nNext, it downsizes my (8984 x 6732) files to 6000px (longest edge) just to make things a little more manageable. This still prints at 50cm / 300dpi which is fine for any magazine or portfolio print. \\n\\nThe flat image is then converted back to 8 bit and saved as a flat, 8 bit, AdobeRGB TIFF file in the \\'print\\' folder. \\n\\nNext, the image converted to sRGB and scaled down to 2048 pixels (longest edge).This image goes to the iPad folder, which is also the folder that goes to clients for large web use so they can scale it down to what they need. The sRGB conversion is important because you don\\'t want to leave that to whatever software the images might encounter later (I\\'ve seen this go horribly wrong). JPEG quality 10 seems to be the best compromise for size/quality.\\n\\nFor iPhone it goes down to iPhone resolution according to longest edge. Again sRGB, JPEG quality 10. \\n\\nFor my website it goes to 640 pixels, but height and not longest edge. Same quality settings. \\n\\nThat\\'s it! One click and a few minutes waiting is all it takes to get my files ready for general use. For clients with specific needs I still need to use custom actions, but this single action saves a ton of time for most things. \\n\\n. So I\\'m about to pull the trigger on the A7ii. I\\'m all set to go via eBay (in europe), which over here is gray market (not too sure if the US is?). The price difference is enough to pay for Sony\\'s f/4 16-70 vs the kit lens on a store bought version.\\n\\nHowever, after reading up, I\\'m pretty sure getting regular firmware updates is a necessity. Does anyone know if firmware upgrades can be uploaded to gray market lenses, or am I stuck with the one its shipped with (which I\\'m not even sure would be the latest)?\\n\\nIf anyone has any prior experience with this issue on *any* Sony gray market camera, I\\'d appreciate it.. With the new Instagram update, uploading photos in portrait and landscape is a breeze. The only problem I\\'ve encountered, is that even my iPhone photos in portrait are cropped a little on Instagram. \\n\\nAnyone know what\\'s the ratio they use ? Because the landscape has no limit I think ,yet the portrait does. . I\\'m asking this question for a friend so if I\\'m a bit vague on the details that\\'s why. If there\\'s any other followup information I need to add please feel free to ask and I\\'ll do my best to get the info from her and update the post. Ok, here we go.\\n\\nA friend of mine recently started a photography side business. She uses a Canon DSLR camera and edits the photos in Photoshop and Lightroom. She came to me with a question the other day since I\\'m her unofficial tech support but I honestly have no idea what\\'s going on. Her original issue was that when she would upload edited photos to Dropbox and then view them from her iPhone or iPad that they would like washed out and dull. My first thought was that either Dropbox was affecting the quality of the photo somehow or that it was simply an issue of the iPhone/iPad screen not being as good as her iMac screen at home. We tested the first theory by having her email the photo to herself, bypassing dropbox. The photo still looked dull. I was just about ready to conclude it was simply an issue with the iPhone/iPad when she pointed out that the same picture when viewed through Facebook on the iOS devices looked exactly the same as on her desktop. The version she emailed herself looks dull but the Facebook version looks like it should. Any idea why this would be? Also, to add even more confusion to the issue, it doesn\\'t seem to be every single photo that suffers from this problem. She has a handful of sample pictures uploaded to her website and when viewing the site from an iPhone and/or iPad some of them look great while some look dull. I suggested maybe it was a specific Photoshop and/or Lightroom technique/action she was using but she couldn\\'t think of a specific one she used on every photo that looked dull but didn\\'t use on the ones that looked great. I\\'m truly stumped. I told her my last resort was to turn to the hive mind on Reddit and see if anyone had any thoughts on the issue.\\n\\nP.S. I\\'m new to this subreddit and wasn\\'t sure if this question should go under the sticked Question Thread or if it was detailed/unique enough to warrant a new posting. If it should go to the Question Thread please let me know and I\\'ll delete this post and post it there instead. Thanks!. I\\'m heading out to shoot the Milky Way on Wednesday and bought this lens specifically for it. Just went out to test it tonight and think mine\\'s defective with the excessive flare and ghosting in the lights. I got it from B&H but I don\\'t have time to return it and test out a new one. Think I\\'m gonna have to find a local one...\\n\\nThoughts on [these pics](http://imgur.com/a/uuk5I)? \\n\\nEXIF data is in the description. No edits other than a 1:1 crop.\\n\\nEdit: decided to go back and shoot with my Nikkor 16-35mm f/4 at the same location and realized it was definitely the lens (updated the album too). Even if it\\'s not defective and that\\'s normal for that lens, I\\'m still gonna return it.. Hey guys, this is interesting given the top link on the group right now is about a magazine stealing a photo.  I just got an offer on Flickr to potentially use one of my photos for the cover of a book. I went ahead and responded asking for title/author and a synopsis to make sure 1) its not a high profile author (seriously doubt it) and 2) to make sure the content is something I\\'m OK having my name associated with.  I\\'m just a semi-amatuer, never sold anything, but glad they took the chance to contact me.\\n\\nI\\'m looking for any other tips/advice for the situation.  Anything you wished you would\\'ve known. \\n\\nI\\'m not looking to be greedy or anything. Assuming it\\'s some random book, I think $100 and a copy or two would be nice.\\n\\nMy Flickr (if you\\'re interested): www.Flickr.com/clemsonpablo\\n\\n**1/16 Update** - Thanks for the advice!  I got the Title, Author and Synopsis back, and it is something I am interesting in being a part of.  It\\'s not some huge name, but she has a couple of other books published and seems to be well received.\\n\\nI\\'ve been in conversations with the author today and turns out we had a pretty common idea of what was to be expected.  So far I\\'ve set up $150 (compromise between the $200 I offered and the $99 price they thought they could get a stock photo for), few copies of the book, credit in the book, limiting it to the book cover (work out another contract later if we need to for other uses).  I finished up at the end of business today saying that I wanted to get this in writing, and am waiting to hear back, which should hopefully be in the morning.  I\\'ve also agreed to provide the RAW because they possibly wanted to tweak the colors.  They also mentioned cropping plus possibly adding a slight vignette to bring focus in on the text, which all seems reasonable to me.  The idea about limiting it to X amount of copies is also a good idea too, although I will make it a fairly high number to keep it reasonable. . Hello r/photography! \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThere was a noticeable \"red boost\" when exporting my images from Photoshop. I was converting a Prophoto 16-bit tiff to an sRGB through the \"save for web\" dialog box and for the life of me I couldn\\'t figure out what was wrong! It wasn\\'t subtle it was like going to the red channel and boosting the saturation by 50%. I spent the whole day, yes the whole freaking day,  trying different solutions I found online. At the end nothing worked so I decided to called it a day and go to sleep. I shut down my computer and head to bed. But I could not go to sleep, I keep thinking of what the issue might be and trying to come up with solutions. Started searching the web again for any hints that could point out the problem was and at the end decided to go back to my computer to try one more thing. And lo and behold the issue was fucking gone!! Just like that! \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI honestly have no idea what \"fix\" was the one that worked but if you\\'re having issues I\\'d recommend that before you start messing with your settings (specially if you haven\\'t had issues before, like me) to just shut down your computer and turn it back on. I sometimes keep my computer on for days so maybe my screen went out of whack. Also I noticed this happened right in sync with the latest chrome update where they changed the look of the tabs and search bar so maybe it was that. Although I also preview my images in Explorer and they too had the red boost so idk. Like I said, I went through several articles and tutorial so I know my Photoshop color settings and exporting parameters were on point! Hence why it was driving me crazy. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTl;dr \\n\\nIf you\\'re having color shift issues and you know your settings are correct, or if you haven\\'t had issues before, just shut down your computer and turn it back on. Also do this after changing a few settings that you think might fix the issue.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;. Hello,\\n\\nI have Nikon D7200 body and thinking about getting very wide lens. I\\'ve seen a lot of good responses about the quality of Tokina\\'s offerings in this range.\\n\\nHowever, I cannot decide between these two:\\n\\n[Tokina AT-X Pro 11-16mm f/2.8 DX II](http://www.tokinalens.com/tokina/products/atxpro/atx116prodxii/)\\n\\n[Tokina ATR-X Pro 11-20mm F2.8 DX](http://www.tokinalens.com/tokina/products/atxpro/atx1120f28prodx/)\\n\\nAre there any noticeable disadvantages of the 11-20 compared to 11-16 ? In image quality, sharpness, focusing speed, handling?\\n\\n\\n--------\\n\\n\\nUPDATE:\\n\\n\\n--------\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve found some reviews and have decided to purchase 11-20. It seems to be a successor to 11-16 DX II and is better optically. Compared to the older model, 82 mm filter thread can be considered a disadvantage. \\n\\n\\nMy personal experience so far is positive overall. AF seems to work correctly with my D7200. Although there were few times where AF didn\\'t switch on properly. Tokina\\'s MF/AF pump switch is the worst thing about this lens, especially when compared to my other lenses that can be focused manually after AF in M/A mode. Image quality is quite good and f/2.8 can be used for handheld shooting in the low light. \\n\\n\\n\\n[http://www.slrlounge.com/tokina-11-20mm-f2-8-dx-review/](http://www.slrlounge.com/tokina-11-20mm-f2-8-dx-review/)\\n\\n\\n[http://www.lenstip.com/index.php?test=obiektywu&test_ob=451](http://www.lenstip.com/index.php?test=obiektywu&test_ob=451). I like the Olympus OM-D EM-5 and obviously the quality of images is far higher than an iPhone but I like the fact that the iPhone can take a wider angle image.\\n\\nAlso the lens on the EM-5 is huge and obtrusive when walking around with it, so:\\n\\n**Is there a pancake lens that offers a similar wide angle view to the iPhone5?**\\n\\nEDIT: The \\'huge\\' lens I was on about was [the one that came with it](http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-M-ZUIKO-DIGITAL-F3-5-6-3-V314040BU000/dp/B0073AIXOA/ref=sr_1_2) although I forgot that it is possible to buy it as \\'body only\\' \\n. Hi ya guys :)\\n\\nToday I received a pair of new SD cards, and a new USB 3.0 SD card reader.\\n\\nBoth as an exercise in writing a semi-scientific report, and just being curious to what the difference is between my USB 3.0 and USB 2 card readers, I decided to do a little benchmarking. While I was at it, I decided to also compare a number of different SD cards I had lying around.\\n\\nSince I wasn\\'t able to find any recent benchmarks on the SD cards online, I figured you might like the outcome of my little study.\\nExcuse the extensive wall of text. I wanted to keep it short and simple, but as I was typing, I kept including more and more, turning it more into a semi-scientific review.\\n\\n###Materials used:\\n\\n##SD HC cards\\n* Sandisk 8GB Extreme 30MB/s\\n* Sandisk 16GB Ultra 30MB/s\\n* Samsung 16 GB 40MB/s W - 80 MB/s R\\n* Samsung 32 GB 40MB/s W - 80 MB/s R\\n\\n##PC:\\n* P8Z77-M PRO (USB 3.0 port used was one on the front)\\n* i5 3570K\\n\\n##USB 3.0 reader: \\n* Transcend TS-RDF8K (with latest TS21 firmware, who knew that you could actually update a card readers\\' firmware?!)\\n\\n##USB 2 reader: \\n* Sitecom MD-018 V1 001\\n\\n##Software used: \\n* H2testw v1.4 (1000 MByte)\\nThis software writes a 1GB piece of information in a single file to the drive, and measures the time it  takes to write, and to read. So basically a sequential test.\\n\\n\\n###Results:\\n\\nCard|USB 3.0 Write speed [MB/s]|USB 3.0 Read speed [MB/s]|USB 2 Write speed [MB/s]|USB 2 Read speed [MB/s]\\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:\\nSandisk 8GB|26.4|41.1|17.3|20.4\\nSandisk 16GB|32.5|41.1|17.8|20.4\\nSamsung 16GB|29.5|70.4|16.4|20.4\\nSamsung 32GB|28.6|70.3|16.3|20.4|\\n\\n\\nEven though both the sandisk cards are promoted with 30MB/s speeds (read or write not specified), which I had assumed to be optimistic, they surprised me by actually reading faster than this. of course, any card will preform best in a sequential test.\\n\\nThe samsung cards didn\\'t do that good in this regard. Both writing and reading speeds were lower than specified. \\nInteresting to note though is that the 16 and 32 GB cards preform almost identically. My experience with Solid State Drives in PCs is that how bigger the drive gets, the faster it will be. Apparently, this doesn\\'t apply to SD cards.\\n\\nThe USB 3.0 speeds are a lot higher than the USB 2 speeds. Because of the little variation between the measured speeds here, I think it is safe to assume that the USB 2 interface is the bottleneck.\\nCurious to see is that the samsung cards are a bit slower than the sandisk cards, in USB 2 write speeds. Since the cards should be able to handle higher speeds, I am unsure about what causes this difference (probably something to do with the internal controller in the SD card).\\n\\n###Discussion:\\nAs far as accuracy goes of these measurements, please take em with a grain of salt.\\nI\\'ve tried another type of software as well, CrystalDiskMark 3.0.2. This is a more extensive test, but I chose not to use this software, because a single test takes much longer.\\nThe results for the 8GB sandisk in H2testw were W 26MB/s, R 41MB/s, while CDM gave W 36MB/s, R 44MB/s.\\nmeaning quite a large difference exists between different methods of measuring speed. You should only compare cards that were measured in the same way.\\n\\n##Did my USB 2 reader reach it\\'s speed limit?\\n\\nyes\\n\\n##Did the USB 3.0 controller reach it\\'s maximum speed?\\n\\nOf this I cannot be entirely sure.\\nWhen I compare the CrystalDiskMark (another piece of measuring software) scores for sequential reading and writing, that I\\'ve found for my samsung 32GB card, to the ones found online, using the same Transcend controller, but a faster SD card (http://www.legitreviews.com/article/2152/2/), I see that the values are higher for that card.\\nThis could indicate that the card is faster, or that something else is hampering my speeds.\\nSince the card tested in the other review is faster than mine, I think we may assume that the transcend card reader is not bottoming out.\\n\\n##Was my USB 2 reader as fast as it could be?\\nSince I kept including more and more in this \"short\" benchmark, I decided i might as well see what speeds I could get when I would stick my USB 3 reader in a native USB 2 port. the result surprised me a bit, since I got 32MB/s R, and 22 MB/s W speeds for my 32 GB card, compared to 20 MB/s R and 16 MB/s W on the other reader.\\n\\nSo no. It\\'s actually a bit slow for a usb 2 reader.\\n\\n\\n###Conclusion:\\nWrite speeds are about the same. The difference lies in the read speeds. For taking photographs, these do not matter. However, If you want to transfer the humongous amount of photos that fit on a 32 GB card onto your PC, the almost double read speeds of the samsung cards might be just what you need.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s definately worth it to upgrade to a USB 3.0 reader, in case you don\\'t own one already.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t buy a sitecom USB 2 reader, they\\'re slow.\\n\\nHope you all find some use in my little benchmark ;). I hate to purchase fotoQuote for something that may be a one off thing, but I dont want to get robbed either. Is this a decent price or should I hold out for more? Thanks!!!!\\n\\n(State edition of a members travel magazine)\\nuse: custom published print magazine\\nplacement: interior\\ncirculation: 341,000\\nsize: spot (small than 1/16 page)\\nduration: 2 months (July/August 2015)\\nrate: $225\\n\\nUPDATE: I Replied back to them that we normally get a little more for licensing our photos for that particular purpose.

Hey guys... wondering if you guys use an app for model releases?  Catherine Hall\\'s Top Model Release app was great, but version 2 never appeared and version 1 doesn\\'t work anymore.  Others in the app store (iOS) haven\\'t been updated in ages, or have mostly bad reviews due to not working with the latest OS.  The 500px \"Releases\" app is what I currently use, but it\\'s missing various features like loading your own releases in and pulling model information from contacts.  It hasn\\'t been updated in almost a year either, and as it\\'s not making them any money, I suspect they have little reason to update or add features to it.\\n\\nWhat do you guys use?  Any hidden gems I\\'m not aware of, I\\'d love some suggestions before spending a few $ to try them all out.  What I\\'m looking for is:\\n\\n - iOS (iphone and ipad preferred)\\n - syncing between devices\\n - export to PDF and share by email\\n - pull contact information from my addressbook\\n - ability to load in my own model releases (ie: a commercial release, a TFP release, property release, etc)\\n - vaguely up to date or at least with a modern app design aesthetic \\n - looks good (obviously subjective)\\n\\nDoes something with some (or even most) of these features, or do I have to learn to make iOS apps and make my own?. So I purchased Lightroom 6 from Best Buy because one, I needed it on my desktop for editing and secondly, I really liked editing on the go with the Lightroom iphone app. \\n\\nI\\'m a bit confused though, I don\\'t get the new L6 update (6.1) and I can\\'t use the mobile lightroom app. I think I can only use it if I had purchased the $10/month package? not sure what\\'s going on..but I just paid $150 and something tells me I fuc*ed up. . I shoot events. Over the last year or so I have experimented with delivering photos directly to subjects smart phones after I have taken the photo. Here are some things of my thoughts about it.\\n\\nThe process goes something like this:\\n\\n1) Take photo in RAW + JPEG (small) while using a wi-fi SD card\\n\\n2 ) Determine what kind of phone the subject has and transfer jpeg photos to ipad for apple phones or android tablet for android phones.\\n\\n3) Connect to subjects phone via Airdrop (iphone 5 and above, iphone 4 lacks this feature) or bluetooth for android phones (sometimes you can use NFC, and/or S-beam for samsung phones)\\n\\n4) transfer photo to subject\\n\\nSometimes it works well, and sometimes it\\'s slow, and sometimes it just doesn\\'t work.\\n\\nHere are some things that I learned along the way.\\n\\n1) The wi-fi SD card can crash and needs to be removed and reinserted\\n\\n2) You need to set your camera from going to sleep for quite a long time otherwise you lose the wi-fi connection and have to reconnect every time. This eats up battery life. \\n\\n3) People leave their bluetooth on and don\\'t name their phones. This means that when you are trying to use bluetooth to transfer in a busy place there might be 20 devices on the list and most are named cryptically (like QT-5432).\\n\\n4) There was a problem with Airdrop which was fixed with an update, but some people seemed to not update their phones. \\n\\n5 ) Crowded wi-fi environments make connecting to the camera unreliable or impossible. I shot an event at a bar and just gave up instant delivery. When I checked my wi-fi signal app, just about every channel was used by multiple devices. There were too many local businesses with wi-fi nearby and my poor SD card was not powerful enough.\\n\\n6 ) Crowded places with lots (thousands) of people with phones seems to effect reliability of the wi-fi/bluetooth connection. \\n\\n7) I\\'m in two minds about giving out unedited photos. People love getting the photos right away, but they are not the best photos they could be getting. Even though they will get the edited photos later as well.\\n\\n8) Even if you have a good wi-fi connection to your camera, sometimes you can\\'t connect to  their phone for whatever reason. \\n\\n9) People don\\'t know how to use all the features on their phones. You have to talk them through the steps they need to do to receive files.\\n\\n**Summary:** I tried but I haven\\'t found a way to reliably transfer photos directly to subject\\'s phones. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n. I am stuck between choosing a Canon (5D Mark II or other may be 6D) or Sony A7RII. I have many canon lenses already. I am taking many things into consideration. Please tell me if I miss anything.\\n\\n    - Camera that is good for landscape photography\\n\\n    - Full frame would be wonderful as I am obsessed with landscape photography\\n\\n    - Not too heavy as I bring camera to trips abroad (I am aware that moving from Olympus OMD EM5 everything is probably going to feel heavy?) \\n\\n    - Occasionally I do street photography. So something with good AF?\\n\\n    - I hope to put photos on my website and hopefully photograph for magazine/print in the future. (I guess it is a long investment?)\\n\\n    - Using these many canon lenses \\n    \\nThe thing is I am going to be able to access a collection of canon lenses. My mother has many canon lenses that she doesn\\'t use. She normally uses her tele lenses for bird photos (using Canon 7D Mark II). So she is more than happy to lend me some other landscape lenses if it doesn\\'t conflict with her schedule (she goes on landscape photography trip like once a year). Actually she is going to kindly give me her 16-35 F2.8 because she doesn\\'t really like it.\\n    \\n    \\nHere is the list of lenses in possession: .\\n\\n\\n\\n    1. 16-35 F2.8\\n\\n    2. 300 F4 \\n\\n    3. 100-400 F4 \\n\\n    4. 18-200 \\n\\n    5. 55-250\\n\\n    6. EFS 55-250\\n\\n    7. 500 F4\\n\\n   \\n    \\n**Concerns with Sony**\\n    A7 RII 5-axis IS built in is very appealing so as its light weight. I read from r/sonyalpha that you can auto focus on Sony A7RII with Metabones T Smart Adapter Mark IV and Canon lenses. Is this correct? There seems to be so many updates of the Sony A7RII and Metabones adapter it is confusing. Is this information true? I am overlooking any thing else?\\n    \\n\\n**Concern with Canon 5D Mark III**\\n    My concern with Canon 5D Mark III is that if I buy it (in April when I hit my funding goal) newer version of Canon 5D Mark III will come out. I make this assumption base on the fact that 5D Mark III was released 4 years ago. The new one is bound to come out? Is this a relatively correct assumption?\\n     \\n\\n**Concern with Canon 6D**\\n    Where I live (Thailand) 6D is regards as low specs and it is very unpopular. It is rather hard to come by. If I were to buy 6D and if I want to sell it later, it is going to be hard to find even a buyer, regardless of the price. Apart from that, with only 11 auto focus point, I am worried that I won\\'t enjoy taking street photography with 6D.\\n    \\n\\n**Concern with Canon 5Ds/5Ds R** \\n    I do not know if I really need 51 megapixel at this point. Also I feel like the price of Canon 5Ds/5Ds R is too expensive for me and it doesn\\'t feel like it is a price for value.\\n    \\n\\n**Budget concerns** \\n    I do not have concern about the budget. Sony A7 RII is pricier than Canon 5D Mark III or 6D (plus I need to buy an adapter with Sony) but if A7RII can work with these Canon lenses, I could just not buy Sony native lenses and save money that way?\\n    \\n\\nAlso I already have hand me down good tripods for landscape (one for mirrorless one for DSLR).\\n    \\n    \\n\\nI am going to a camera shop this Saturday to hold both Canon 5D Mark III (and may be Canon 6D) and Sony A7 RII to see which one is more comfortable. (I have rather small hands but in the past I feel Olympus OMD EM5 and Canon 7D Mark II to be equally ok to hold and set up) I guess it might come down to which one feels right in my hand but I would really appreciate if Reddit community points out anything that I may overlook/miss.\\n    \\n    \\n\\nPlease kindly advice. I am very open for suggestion for other models.\\n    \\n\\nI am very sorry for my English sentences. Obviously English is not my first language. I thank you very much in advance.\\n\\nedit: formatting is hard.... So, last year I bought a 70D. I really like it. Two ish years ago, I bought a T3i. Also a really good (if somewhat more basic, relatively speaking.) \\n\\nI have the following lenses:\\ncanon: 50mm f1.8, 55-250 USM, 18-135 STM \\nManuals:\\nVivitar f2.8 135mm (M42 to EF) with a 2x tele to go to.... 270mm-ish at f/4ish? (favorite old glass for low light stage work) \\nNikon f3.5 28mm AI-S (F to EF) (lovely landscapes/etc)\\nRokinon f1.4 85mm EF \\n\\nThese represent my usual travel partners. \\n\\nAnyway, I got the Promaster 7200EDF-CN on a clearance. It\\'s pretty good for my T3i, works great. Very bright. 70D doesn\\'t like it, I get maybe a 1/16 pop at best. \\n\\nMy strategy was as a dual shooter was to put my primes on the T3i because it\\'s only ISO 6400 max, and doesn\\'t have the dual pixel AF that the 70D does (and with STM that stuff is magical).... and to shoot the compound lenses with the big flash when situations called for it. Now, I can\\'t do that with the flash if it doesn\\'t work with the 70D. \\n\\nI understand there may be a firmware update, but I can\\'t seem to find anyplace to do it or get it done. \\n\\n1 - where could I get this update, or am I borked... \\n2 - Could I switch the camera roles and still be okay? Seems like I\\'m throwing away all the 70d\\'s niftiness that way... \\n\\nThanks! . I\\'m looking at getting a small light meter, fairly cheap, etc... I shoot with a lot of old rangefinders, and most of them in my collection do not have any sort of built in meter. I can guess pretty well when it\\'s a bright day outdoors (sunny 16 heck yeah!) but any other time, I usually screw up a bunch.\\n\\nI looked around, and [this seems to be what I\\'m looking for (Sekonic L-208 Twinmaster)](http://www.henrys.ca/4761-SEKONIC-L-208-TWINMATE.aspx), but I was wondering if anyone had any other suggestions, or maybe even some experience with that meter.\\n\\nI like the fact that it is small, and does incident as well as reflected metering. Also I can stick it on the hot shoe of my camera, which is convenient.\\n\\nAnyway, what I am looking for is;\\n \\n* small\\n* inexpensive\\n* reflective + incident metering\\n* can be clipped onto the camera (see the first point.)\\n* rugged (I don\\'t want it falling apart on me!)\\n\\nSo, would the Sekonic L-208 Twinmaster be my best bet? Or is there something else out there that would be better?\\n\\n**[Update]** So, for anyone caring, I ended up going with the L-208. I was suggested the Gossen Digisix, but after comparing the two, I ended up liking the Sekonic better. Either way, I know it will get some good use. Thanks for all who helped!. I have a Dell Inspiron 6400, Core 2 Duo processor at 2.16 GHz, 2GB RAM (I know, I know; you don\\'t have to tell me). Got it long before I ever intended on attempting photography or getting a DSLR. The main (best) card I\\'m using right now is a SanDisk Ultra 8GB Class 4. Whenever there are any pictures on the card and I try to open/preview/edit them in any program (Windows Picture Viewer/thumbnails in Explorer/Lightroom/Photoshop), they load pretty damn slow, and transferring them is even worse. We\\'re talking several minutes for all the thumbnails to load in any simple image viewer. I\\'m wondering if upgrading to a firewire card reader would help my situation any, as I\\'m thinking it\\'s mostly reading-from-the-card speed and not power-of-my-computer speed. I will be updating my computer here shortly if things go as planned, BTW, so shut up.. [Rumor has it](http://nikonrumors.com/2011/12/16/updated-nikon-d800-specs.aspx/) that the Nikon D800 will be available in two versions: with and without an anti-aliasing filter. I\\'ve been looking at some [examples](http://www.maxmax.com/nikon_d300HR.htm) from existing cameras that have had their AA filter removed, and I have to say the improvements in sharpness look very impressive. On the other hand, the increased risk of moiré looks like a big drawback, especially for shooting fashion. \\n\\nDoes anyone here have experience with a camera that had its AA filter removed? I know the M9 and most digital backs lack an AA filter and they are crazy sharp. Is there any good reason to have an AA filter at all except to combat moiré? . * **Budget**: $350\\n* **Country**: I buy from USA; mostly Amazon, Ebay or wherever they accept international Paypal.\\n* **Condition**: new, open box, used, refurbished\\n* **Type of Camera**: Mirrorless\\n* **Intended use**: hybrid shooting\\n* **If photography; what style**: night pics; decent pics of wide landscapes\\n* **If video what style**: flashlight beams in different colors, shot at night from high positions over a wide scenery for youtube; urban and semi rural walks at night time; live streaming of my exercises (to monitor form in real time, for my eyes only)\\n* **What features do you absolutely need**: good low light/nighttime capability; good image stabilization; evf; USB-C 3.0+ connectivity; SDXC and compatibility with recent storage; 1080p+; USB-C charging; good battery life (1600mah is too little imo); compact and inconspicuous; Windows and Android compatiblity;  better image quality than current top phone cameras, like the iPhone 16 Pro Max or the Vivo X100 ultra\\n* **What features would be nice to have**: wifi and/or Bluetooth for transfers; H.265 support; multiple card slots; articulated LCD (not for selfies); RAW; 20MP+; 4K+; HDMI cat 2+ (10.2GB+); live transfer capability; capable of recording night vision (I have IR flashlights); analog audio jack (I have separate audio equipment); 3000mah+ battery capacity; support for 21700 or 18650 batteries (don\\'t know if this is even a thing for cameras but it should); interchangeable/upgradeable lenses (I guess for more zoom and wider pics)\\n* **Portability**: handheld, can fit comfortably in a small backpack\\n* **Cameras you\\'re considering**: Sony A series (particularly the A7s) and Panasonic G series look fitting but they\\'re either way too expensive or older models with USB 2.0. ZV-1F comes close but video quality looks no better than a flagship phone imo. So far it seems that with my connectivity and storage requirements and the price point the only realistic options would be action cameras but I the low light performance it kinda sucks to my untrained eye. I read phones have better low light performance but the phones with the best cameras are around $800 and I have no use for all the other features, my Redmi Note 7 more than fulfills all my phone needs..\\n* **Cameras you already have**: Redmi Note 7 :-)\\n* **Notes**: I don\\'t expect nor need professional-grade results. It\\'s not for filmmaking nor art photography. I\\'m not shooting wildlife or sports. I just need night videos that have better quality than those recorded with flagship phones. I\\'m big on updated storage and connectivity/compatibility because I dread the pita of being unable to retrieve and transfer the video smoothly because of an obscure format, aged media or lack of a niche accessory.\\n\\nAppreciate your advice. Thank you!. I was so excited to try out the new-to-me A7iii, I unboxed it and I was perplexed at the tiny size, the bright orange ring in the mount, for a second I understand why people loved them.\\n\\nThen I grabbed it, instant horror, imagine I come from using a 90D and a 5DIV... with the Sony my pinky finger is in the air, using a Zeiss 16-35mm fells so imbalanced, I thought \"not big deal, I can get a battery grip\", but there is more, holding a Sony A7 is like holding an small brick, no curves, everything regarding ergonomy is still on its infancy compared to Canon or Nikon.\\n\\nI accepted it was an small price to pay and moved on, only to find the menus, they are a mess! plus you can\\'t use the touch screen for anything except focusing and zooming images in playback mode...\\n\\nNot everything is bad though, the image quality is incredible in low light, however I found out why people say that Sony colors are bad, the green hue in the images is awful compared to Canon colors, but nothing that cannot be corrected in post.\\n\\nEye AF is highly regarded on Sony cameras, but the 90D has a similar performance on Live View mode.\\n\\nSony apps are way behind Canon\\'s and Nikon\\'s apps in many regards.\\n\\nYou can\\'t update firmware in Apple silicon  unless you are willing to restart in safe mode and enable insecure mode to install Sony driver extensions.\\n\\nAfter 2 months now I consider that the Sony cameras are the iPhones of this world.\\n\\nTL;DR: got a Sony thinking it was the perfect camera due to all the hype and got disappointed in every regard except IQ in low light.. I\\'m replacing a Pentax Optio VS20 which was an excellent camera, except that it weighs too much and its batteries are becoming increasingly difficult to get.  \\nOptio has x20 optical zoom and takes 16mp shots.  \\nQuestionnaire:\\n\\n  \\n**Budget**:   Under $500 U.S., ideally\\n\\n**Country**: South Korea, though a trip to Japan to buy is also possible. Ordering online is also fine.\\n\\n**Condition**: New preferred, but open to used.  Even a used iPhone is an option if it does what I need it to do.\\n\\n**Type of Camera**: Digital point and shoot, 16 MP or better\\n\\n**Intended use**: Photography, mostly\\n\\n**If photography; what style**: primarily wildlife--urban, suburban, rural.  Birds, insects.  Some people, some landscapes, some sunsets. Neon lights and the like, on occasion.\\n\\n**If video what style**: ocean waves, spiders doing their thing, shots that will end up as gifs or ambiance videos\\n\\n**What features do you absolutely need**:  Lightweight--I can\\'t get the shot if I\\'m not carrying my camera. Decent battery life or the ability to carry spare batteries. \\n\\n**What features would be nice to have**:\\n\\n**Portability**: Absolute need. Must fit into a common purse or jacket pocket.\\n\\n**Zoom:**  optical is preferred to digital\\n\\n**Cameras you\\'re considering**: IPhone 11 (used).  Portable, and I\\'ve seen them take great night shots.  No idea whether software updates would become a problem, and I would likely not use it for an actual phone.\\n\\n**Cameras you already have**: Pentax Optio VS20.  Perfect shots, but chonky in a purse.--  Narrative Lifelogger--delightful, but impossible to replace so I worry about wearing it out, lest I lose it again. There is such thing as too small.-- Sony action camera--nice for sports but too heavy to wear on head as designed, so I rarely use it. Takes great time-lapse photos.\\n\\n* **Notes**: (any other considerations you think we should know about).  Hi everyone,\\n\\nI always wanted a camera. I like taking photos but I wasn\\'t sure if I would use it a lot.\\n\\nI asked around and every person that has a camera(for hobby) ended up not using it frequently because \\n\\n1) taking photos and videos on an iphone was just easier. \\n\\n2) Cameras are heavier\\n\\n3) It\\'s easier to share photos on social media on phones.\\n\\n So I decided to get an iphone 13 pro max. I like taking videos with it.  I like taking photos of flowers nature and videos of city and walking sequences.\\n\\nIt\\'s been 3 years now and I want sell my iphone and get a camera instead.\\n\\nI did some research but it\\'s overwhelming with many options.\\n\\nThis would be the first camera I\\'d buy so I don\\'t have experience. I watched many comparision videos but I\\'m still not sure which direction I should take.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to buy the new iPhone.

Hey everyone,\\nI’m just getting into photography/video as a hobbyist, mainly to capture fun and creative moments with my friends. I already have an iPhone 16 Pro Max, which has a great camera, but I’ve been eyeing the Canon PowerShot V1 for something a bit more dedicated.\\n\\nI’m wondering—would it actually be worth the investment if I’m still new to cameras? Would the difference in image quality, especially for more enthusiast-level content, be noticeable enough compared to what my iPhone can already do?\\n\\nI’d really appreciate some honest opinions, especially from anyone who’s made a similar jump or has experience with both. Is it worth it for the upgrade or should I just stick with the iPhone and maybe learn more before spending the extra money?\\n\\nThanks!. I figure that the iPhone has some kind of fixed aperture, not sure what it is tho, and I’m also not sure what the F stops of an iPhone compares to say, the Sony E mount 18-135mm OSS kit lens. . Just wondering. I hear this all the time but don’t know why that is . Newbie here, I am going to Japan in a couple of months, from where I am planning to get a second-hand lumix g9 with second hand lenses as well. However, a person I know also told me to consider going for an iPhone 16 pro as the computational photography on that phone rivals many cameras.\\n\\nMy question is, whether I should go for a second hand micro four thirds setup, or get an iphone 16 pro for the same price? Have iphones really levelled the playing field with computational photography? And is it worth going for a micro four thirds setup despite its smaller sensor size compared to APS-C?\\n\\n  \\nI do both photography and videography, so I would like to know what would be a better choice for me. Help would be appreciated!. I have been going through this reddit because I am looking for a nice camera for pictures on my upcoming vacation. I want a point and shoot camera because it is easier than the mirrorless OM System camera I had for the last vacation.\\n\\nWith that said though it seems like people are saying in this reddit that I might as well not even waste my time or money on a point and shoot camera, and should instead just upgrade and get the iphone 16 pro and that would take just as good of pictures as say the Canon Powershot G7s or the Richoh III. \\n\\n  \\nIs that right? Is the best option for a casual photo taker the iphone 16 pro and not one of the compact point and shoot cameras on the market?.

Hi guys...I have a question!  I am setting up to do some amateur table top, small item photography but I can\\'t decide what camera to use.  I don\\'t own an DSLR yet but I do have an older Fugi S4250WX FinePix 14mp camera and I have an iPhone 16 Pro Max.  I am really comfortable with the iPhone but I notice a lot of the photos come out at 9mp but the photos are really nice for a cell phone, LOL!  So yeah..that\\'s the big question!  Would I be better off using the latest tech with the iPhone or use a 12 year old entry level camera to produce some quality work?\\n\\nEventually, I want to get something like a Cannon EOS 2000D but I just don\\'t have the funds right now so I have to use what I have!  \\n\\nThanks for any and all insight!. hello!

I’m finding that, in all honesty, I’m not a great photographer in terms of composition and theory (nor do I want to be) I’m purely here for the love of the game and to capture moments in good quality. This often means that I’ll take a nice but dodgy photo that I need to crop in and mess around in editing to turn it into something I like, hence why a higher megapixel count is important to me as it seems to preserve the quality the more I crop in or at least it gives me more to play with before the quality reaches what I’d call “unusable”. \\n\\nMy issues with the iPhone 16 are that it doesn’t tend to do well when lights are pointed at it, for example taking a photo of my cat in the Christmas tree yields poor results due to the camera trying to compensate for the lights and then the cat disappearing into a dark mush. This also happens when I’m out and about. I’m sure a larger sensor and a camera that isn’t basically 12MP digitally enhanced would help (despite the iPhone 16 pro being “48MP” a third of those megapixels are computational inserted from what I understand, and it just doesn’t compare to a proper camera). Not to mention that it will only use the 48MP mode under very good lighting conditions, which even outdoors at noon in the grey UK doesn’t happen often, so I’m stuck with 12MP photos 99% of the time. \\n\\nOnce upon a time I had the Fuji XT-4, loved it’s reasonably high megapixel count and high quality images, but now I’m looking for something more compact like Sony Cybershot RX100 (in terms of form factor). •\\t\\u2060Budget: $650\\n•\\t\\u2060Country: USA\\n•\\t\\u2060Condition: new\\n•\\t\\u2060Type of Camera: canon r50\\n•\\t\\u2060Intended use: casual photography and pics of myself and friends\\n•\\t\\u2060If photography; what style: \\n•\\t\\u2060If video what style:\\n•\\t\\u2060What features do you absolutely need:\\n•\\t\\u2060Portability:\\n•\\t\\u2060Cameras you\\'re considering:\\n•\\t\\u2060Cameras you already have:\\n•\\t\\u2060Notes:\\n\\nI just want to know if the camera will make a huge difference in pics or if it would be nice to have.

Want more portability\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nSo here is the deal. I make talking head videos, mostly about history.\\n\\nMy current camera is a Sony Zve 10 with a 16mm Sigma. The quality is good, and it works fine if I am at home or even when I am in a hotel room. It\\'s a bit of a pain though if I want to walk and talk or even just carry and set up at an outdoor location.\\n\\nI have been traveling a lot more lately and also want to start filming more outside. I am also a one-man band so to speak so I would like to downsize the amount of gear I need to carry for videos.\\n\\nSo my question is this. Have cell phone cameras gotten good enough yet? For my use, could I switch the iPhone 16 Pro Max for shooting in well-lit outdoor environments, and various indoor environments (including hotel rooms) without a major loss in quality? I\\'m not expecting to be able to get clear video at sunset, or walking down the street at night but how about for normal situations?\\n\\nIs the iPhone going to be prone to overheating when shooting in 4k?\\n\\nI know I would have to probably carry around a portable SSD to store my footage but I already have a few of them and store my footage on them anyway so that\\'s not a large issue for me.\\n\\nAnything else I should be aware of before considering making the switch?\\n\\nPs, my current phone is a three-year-old Samsung A53 that is pretty beaten up with lots of scratches on the camera lens (it went sliding down the pavement one day after falling out of my pocket on a bike ride) so I really can\\'t make a judgment on if it will work based on my current phone\\'s capabilities.\\n\\nI was planning on waiting until the new iPhone SE was available to replace it, but if I can replace my camera with something like the 16 Pro Max without hurting my quality I like that idea.. Can anyone recommend me strong Overhead/point of view mount/tripod whatever it is called that supports iphone 16 pro max. I am a nail tech and planning of recording my works for instagram and youtube. Budget ia not a problem just need to be very stable amd portable. #mount #iphone16promax. a month ago i got interested in photography, i have iphone 16 pro max so i has an opportunity to make some decent photos. today i found father\\'s canon 700d. what do u think which camera is the best one? what should i use? i am interested in street photography and daily one.

I own a food business and have had the Sony ZV1 for a while and have been using it for food photography & some reels.\\n\\nI find myself opting to use my iPhone 12 Pro to shoot reels instead of the ZV1 for the ease of use as well as exporting to CapCut etc.\\n\\nI want to shoot a lot more video content - should I sell the ZV1 and get an iPhone 15 or 16 pro?\\n\\nWhat reasons would it make sense to keep the ZV1 and use it?. I’m a high school student and entered a national business competition where we have to create a a 30-second PSA video. I have two cameras available: a Canon EOS 7D and an iPhone 16 Pro Max.\\n\\nThe iPhone’s camera is great, but it lacks the \"professional\" look of a real camera, that I want. I\\'ve seen that you can use a depth scanner and a lens blur map to simulate depth of field with iPhone LOG footage, but I’ve never tried it before and the plugin is also not free.\\n\\nOn the other hand, my Canon EOS 7D only shoots 1080p and produces a pretty soft image, though it has that depth of field look built-in. I also heard that Magic Lantern could improve its video quality, but apparently the workflow can be kind of complicated and laborious (not 100% sure what that means).\\n\\nShould I use my iPhone and add depth of field artificially in After Effects, or go through the effort of using Magic Lantern on my \\\\~14 year-old DSLR? I’m also not a fan of the cinematic mode on the iPhone—I want the PSA to look as professional and realistic as possible.\\n\\nWould appreciate any advice or other suggestions! Thanks!. I’m a bit of a camera enthusiast but don’t have that much bucks to buy an expensive one. I have the Nikon Z30 though. It’s good, I guess, but has a bad autofocus and not that portable imo. I want something that I can carry in my pocket all the time. So the Ricoh GR3x fits the bill, but then again, a phone is still the thing that we always carry around. So, I was thinking if I should wait to upgrade my phone to the IPhone 16 pro when it launches in a few months or get the Ricoh gr3x. Is the GR3x significantly better than an IPhone pro in terms of image quality? . UPDATE: [Here\\'s a Buying Guide to go With This Post. Everyone Hates it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/s/Fg5oCoIUE7)\\n\\nI tried to get into photography a half dozen times between 2012 and 2021. Every time I tried using my phone, got bored and frustrated, and quit.\\n\\nIn 2021 I bought a 2006 DSLR with a kit lens at a yard sale and instantly started taking better photos. I\\'ve upgraded bodies and added to my lens collection since, and actually feel good enough to start doing paid gigs now.\\n\\nIt never would have happened if I had tried to learn photography on my phone again. Here\\'s why:\\n\\n1. Phones hide what the camera is doing. Everything about phone camera systems is set up to point, shoot, and get an \"accurate\" picture every time. There\\'s so much computation behind every shot that looking at the shutter speed / iso is pointless to learn how the shot came together. The interfaces are frustrating to manually set parameters, and usually the shots come out worse when you do. On the other hand, even in auto a dedicated camera is surfacing all those parameters and putting control at your fingertips. \\n\\n2. Interface and ergonomics matter. Holding a phone to take pictures feels bad. It\\'s not easy for me to hold steady and I\\'m always shooting off angle because there\\'s no viewfinder, and changing settings is cramp inducing. Actually holding up a camera to your eye makes composition so much easier to learn. \\n\\n3. Phone pictures look OK in almost all settings, dedicated cameras look great within their limits. Yeah, low light photos on an iphone have less noise than even cameras from 5 years ago. Daylit photos on a 20 year old camera still beat an iphone almost every time. Most 10-year old bodies are even good in very low light.\\n\\n4. The only consistently good photographers I\\'ve seen use iphones learned on a dedicated camera, and for the most part still use them. Taking great photos on a phone feels like a party trick that pro photographers do to make a point.\\n\\n5. Old cameras are so damn cheap. For less than $100 you can get a used Nikon D3000 and the 18-55 kit lens it came with, and you\\'ll have so much more fun than trying to use your phone. You can go even older for less money and still get amazing shots. And the camera won\\'t slow to a crawl when Apple issues a new iOS update in September.\\n\\nRemember when cell phones were going to kill handheld game consoles? It doesn\\'t matter that my phone is technically a multiple more powerful than a Nintendo switch; it\\'s an awful way to play anything besides a true time waster. And my boss never bugs me on my switch.\\n\\nStop telling people that want to buy a camera to learn on their phone first.\\n\\nEDIT: I\\'m not talking about when people ask how to get \"better pictures.\" I\\'m specifically talking about when someone says they either want a dedicated camera or wants to learn photography. If they\\'re already at this point, a phone isn\\'t going to provide the experience they want.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Imagine I walk into a shoe store and tell the associate, \"I want to get a pair of cowboy boots. I haven\\'t had any before, but I\\'d like some that will look good, and I don\\'t want to spend too much money.\"\\n\\nA good employee will ask me what I plan to do with them, clarify my budget, and either give me options in that price range or explain what I\\'d need to pay to get started.\\n\\nA bad employee will tell me to just wear my sneakers because clearly, I\\'m not serious about getting \"into\" boots.\\n\\nIf you tell people to \"just use their phone\" when they are asking for recommendations on cameras, you\\'re the bad employee.\\n\\nEDIT 3: That Chase Jarvis quote is a marketing tagline to sell a photo book. The dude shot professionally for over a decade, timed the market for when phone photography was an emerging novelty, and got the bag. Now he\\'s just another hustlebro on Twitter.. My wife and I have tried everything, but we can\\'t get her CoolPix B500 to connect to her iPhone using the SnapBridge app.  We\\'ve tried both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.  She recently upgraded to iOS 16.3.1, and she now gets a message that Nikon is aware of a problem with iOS 16.3.1.  Is there a solution or workaround that anyone is aware of?. Which one for video? Which one is better?. This is a little project of mine I\\'ve been trying to get fully up and running again, a Kodak DCS 420 from 1994/95.  Got it in incredible condition from a guy who bought it for the full price of $12,000 back then for his Plastic Surgery office in Miami! Came with the charger, originally optioned 50mm f1.8 and Tiffen IR filter, and all accompanying paperwork in a huge binder. Already done the hard work of refurbishing, including rebuilding a new NIMH battery for it. And I\\'m able to process photos properly using old Photoshop 3 and accompanying drivers, although at this point its a convoluted process. \\n\\nCurrently, it refuses to accept any flash cards, CF or PCMCIA, Fat 16 or Fat 32, so I\\'m forced to use a Win98 Laptop that can fit it\\'s 2 slot PCMCIA hard drive that it came with, which will likely only work for so much longer. I\\'ve tried 6 different CFs with varying capacities and a dedicated PCMCIA flash card, all with a similar \"E2\" error, which generally means it failed to initialize. From my own research it seems the most likely culprit is the firmware, as I\\'ve read others had the same issue back then before having it remedied by an update. But obviously, since this camera\\'s come out so long ago now, I can\\'t seem to find a link to the firmware anywhere.\\n\\nWhile I already have a couple old laptops that can communicate with the hard drive perfectly and edit its files on photoshop, ideally I\\'d want to ditch the hard drive all together and use exclusively flash media, whether that\\'s to transfer to a modern or vintage pc. \\n\\n**So if ANYONE knows where I could possibly find a DCS 420 firmware Update to finally get this guy running right with flash, I\\'d greatly appreciate it.** I have to imagine someone out there has it just sitting on an old drive waiting to be archived.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nP.S, The only thing I haven\\'t tried that one or two old forum posts said to do was format the flash drive through the SCSI connection. I\\'m waiting on a SCSI adapter to try with my only SCSI capable computer, so hopefully that can be a bandage fix, though I\\'m not optimistic it will work. We\\'ll see!. Hi Reddit! Please excuse me if I sound like a complete beginner, it\\'s because I am lol\\n\\n**TL;DR:** Looking for a good camera around $3000 to shoot 120FPS 4K indoors (cooking videos, lighting equipment available).\\n\\nMy wife started content creation recently-she makes and uploads cooking videos.\\n\\nSo far, she has been shooting on my iPhone 16 Pro Max, which I guess has been okay since I bought her some nice lighting equipment. She had tons of friends help her channels grow so they are quickly gaining traction and because of this, she told me she wants to get very serious about it. \\n\\nAs I\\'m sure you know, despite videography being very good on the new iPhones, you\\'re still very limited in almost every aspect. I do basic video editing for her and it doesn\\'t matter what I do, the video quality (especially on 4K) is *not really the best*.\\n\\nShe\\'s a very talented cook + she\\'s extremely personable, so I think she\\'s choosing the right career. I believe in her and want to invest in her dream, so I want your recommendation on what would be the best camera that can/is:\\n\\n* Shoot 4K 120FPS, for those nice slow-mo shots.\\n* I\\'ve got \\\\~$5000 to put into this, so something around $3000 to spare money for the lense(s) would be best.\\n* Something that indoor shooting won\\'t be a problem for (she shoots only indoors)\\n\\n**P.S.:** From what I\\'ve read so far, $3000 is probably overkill for a beginner camera, but I also intend to find & enroll her into a good videography course so she won\\'t be a beginner for long.\\n\\nThanks!. I mean no offense but are digital cameras worth buying? Ive been considering getting myself a digital camera (Nikon D7100) cuz i really want to get into the photography hobby.

Hey everyone!\\nI was browsing for a new small and portable camera for travelling, maybe a rugged one for outdoor activities (such as kayaking or horse riding). I used to have an entry level dslr (Nikon d5300) but stopped using it a long time ago in favour of smartphones, due to its size and impracticability in spontaneous situations.\\nI was initially considering a good camera smartphone instead, but i\\'m also thinking that I could rekindle my interest for photography and have more options.\\nCurrently I have three options: 1.

We own a horse business and make videos of our horses for advertising in instagram and FB so they need to be verticle and super high quality.

It\\'s a long time wish of mine to get one and experiment. Also fairly new to editing though I have some grip on Photoshop.\\n\\nPurchase plan: I stay in India. Will be getting the camera during my next work trip or through a cousin. Hence, purchase in the next 3 months or so. . I’m a proponent of 8K60 recording, as I think it would be cool. And I understand that it takes time to develop this processing technology - like with 4K60. The first 4K30 phone was the Galaxy Note 3, in Sep 2013, and the first 4K60 phone was the iPhone 8 in Sep 2017. The GoPro HERO6 Black was also released in Sep 2017, and it could also do 4K60 video.\\n\\nAnd I know of the Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 12K camera that can do 8K120, but I also know about its ridiculous price tag of $6,385 - more than the family Equinox. More than 2 months worth of rent. Not to mention, the camera records video in a proprietary format: Blackmagic RAW. I prefer H.265 for convenience, and to save storage space. \\n\\nFor reference, a 16:9 8K60 video in Blackmagic RAW 18:1 is 1344 Mbit/s, and 18:1 is the lowest available quality mode in Blackmagic RAW.\\n\\nNow notice something. The first 8K30 phone was the Xiaomi Mi 10, released in Feb 2020. \\n\\nAnd we have phones and GoPros that can record in 4K120 - which I consider to be the same thing as 8K30, when doing some calculations. The first 4K120 phone was the Sony Xperia 1 II, released in May 2020. GoPros could record in 4K120 starting with the HERO10, released in Sep 2021. The more recent iPhone 16 Pro can do 4K120.\\n\\nAnd in Nov 2023, Insta360 came out with the Ace and the Ace Pro 1, both capable of 4K120 recording, the Ace Pro 1 capable of 8K24 recording. Next year in October (a few months ago), they came out with the Ace Pro 2, capable of 8K30 recording. Also a few months ago - in September - DJI came out with the Osmo Action 5 Pro, capable of fullscreen (4:3) 5.3K/120 recording in H.265!\\n\\nThat’s 3840 x 2880 x 120 = 1,327,104,000 pixels / second of H.265 rendering, for “only” $349 (standard combo), at 120 Mbit/s (max bitrate)!\\n\\nAnd 7680 x 4320 = 33,177,600.\\n\\nAnd 1,327,104,000 / 33,177,600 = 40!\\n\\nSo I suspect we’re going to have cheaper 8K60-capable cameras with either the Osmo Action 6 Pro, or the 7 Pro.. • Budget: <500 dollars \\n• Country: USA\\n• Condition: New only \\n• Type of camera: I really don’t know!\\n• Intended use: video and photography \\n• If photography; what style: photographing professional set builds he does \\n• If video what style: he has expressed interest in making time lapse videos of his process building the sets \\n• What features do you absolutely need: no clue!\\n• What features would be nice to have: maybe something on the small side?\\n• Portability: should be able to take it on a plane in a carry on\\n• Cameras you\\'re considering: so far I’ve only looked at go pros \\n• Cameras you already have: he does not own any!\\n• Notes: mostly just looking for something relatively easy to use that will allow him to take time lapse videos and some pictures or his sets so he can use those in his portfolio.

I have a small travel Youtube channel and am looking for camera recommendations for both photography and videography. I primarily shoot videos of street walks and famous landmarks but will also occasionally include people and animals. I also take pictures for thumbnails and for my personal photos.\\n\\nI currently use an iPhone 16 with a gimbal but am looking to upgrade to better equipment, and this will be my first camera.

I’m interested in the a6400 because as mentioned it seems like a fairly impressive camera for what I’m looking for, however my previous camera is a hand-me-down, and having never bought a camera personally I’m completely out of touch as to what a reasonable price to pay for a new camera should be. I’m not sure if I’m over looking alternatives that are much better for the same price, or if I’m over paying all together and should consider something much cheaper. .

Also wondering if i should just stick to my iphone 16 pro on pro res log. any advice is appreciated!!!. Hi everyone! I need help with camera recommendations, **summary** is at the end. My problem is I want my pictures to have that digital camera effect/vibe which I don’t think you can get with just your phone. However I just bought a new Iphone 16 base and with my budget I can’t afford to buy a camera for $1000 \\xa0so I’m looking for a budget friendly digital camera that can still give me the same type of pictures. Before anyone comes at me for this, I’ve seen many people say that it’s not about the camera but it’s about the settings. That’s why I came here for help. I initially wanted to ask about the kodak pixpro FZ55 but then I saw another post on here and people told OP it’s the worst camera. So I’m a little confused. Anyways I answered the questionnaire but keep in mind I actually have no knowledge about cameras but did my best to answer because people here are professionals.\\xa0\\n\\n* **Budget**: If it’s brand new I would say between 300 or 400 USD. If used I could go for maximum of 300 usd.\\n* **Country**: Sweden\\n* **Condition**: Preferably new but used is fine.\\n* **Type of Camera**: point and shoot, (compact camera)\\n* **Intended use**: Photography, self portraits and capturing surroundings.\\n* **If photography; what style**: landscape, portrait, street, beaches\\n* **If video what style**: I don’t intend to use it for vlogging so it’s not a priority.\\n* **What features do you absolutely need**: compact digital camera with a built-in flash, good low-light performance, and a sensor that provides better image quality than the IPhone 16 (no visible pixelation)\\n* **What features would be nice to have**: Flip up screen for self portraits.\\n* **Portability**: Pocketable or small bag. It should be compact and lightweight for easy carrying as I will use It mostly when traveling.\\n* **Cameras you\\'re considering**: Moreso cameras I want but can’t get because of the price or availability in Sweden. You can find most of these on Ebay but they resell for so much more than the original price.\\xa0\\n\\n**Canon G7X** – known for it’s good image quality, especially in low light, and it’s compact size. The flip-up screen is also useful for self-portraits, and it has a decent lens with a good balance of zoom.\\n\\n**Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 III** – good low-light performance, 1-inch sensor, and built-in viewfinder. It’s compact,\\xa0\\n\\n**Panasonic Lumix DMC LX15** – great for low-light situations. It’s compact size, image quality,\\xa0\\n\\n**Panasonic Lumix TZ200** – 1-inch sensor and a good optical zoom range. It\\'s compact, offers solid performance in low light, built-in flash, which is one of my key requirements.\\n\\n**Panasonic Lumix DMC LX100** – image quality, particularly in low light, built in flash.\\xa0\\n\\n**Canon Powershot SX740 HS** – good zoom capabilities in a compact form, decent balance of features, built in flash.\\n\\n* **Cameras you already have**: I have none and I’m a beginner so I don’t actually know anything about cameras, which is why I’m making this post.\\n* **Notes**: I just want the pictures to turn out crisp and for reference I’ll post some photos taken with different cameras I found on TikTok.\\xa0 I’m not too concerned about technical specs like having a 1-inch sensor, as long as the camera can deliver the kind of photos I’m looking for.\\n\\n**SUMMARY**: I mostly want to use the camera for self portraits and photography and capturing the surrounding as I want to use it on my vacation. I’m looking for the same results that you get with the canon g7x (crips, good low light performance) and built in flash. Budget: $300-$400, used is also fine. Honestly as long as the camera is better than my iphone 16 OR can get me the digital camera photos effect. I’m not too concerned about technical specs like having a 1-inch sensor, as long as the camera can deliver the kind of photos I’m looking for. I’d also like to clarify what I mean by good low light performance, I’m referring to using the flash (so the images aren’t pixelated even with the flash), such as for taking pictures at the beach during sunset etc.. Hey, I\\'m going on Safari in Kenya at the start of June. I\\'m fairly clueless about cameras, lenses etc and what I would definitely need/what would be nice but not essential.\\n\\n* **Budget**: £400\\n* **Country**: UK\\n* **Condition**: New or Used is good, only preference is a good battery life \\n* **Type of Camera**: I\\'m open to different types of cameras as long as they offer good zoom capabilities and a good battery life. I would prefer one slightly easier to use but have got time to practice if not.\\n* **Intended use**: Photography\\n* **If photography; what style**: Wildlife and Landscape on Safari \\n* **Portability**: To be kept in a backpack \\n* **Cameras you already have**: I have a \\\\~15 year old fujifilm Finepix S6500 fd. I also have a Kenko UV 58mm Lens and a Neewer Digital high definition 2x telephoto lens. I know the camera is well past it and the lenses are probably awful knock offs ahahah. My dad used to be keen on photography and gave me his hand me down camera about 8 years ago. Lately the camera is claiming low battery even with brand new ones in (if anyone knows how to fix this feel free to give me advice lmao). I like the style of this camera but looking for some sort of upgrade.\\n* **Notes**: I have an iPhone 16 and while it is great for everyday shots, I\\'m really hoping to get something with a much longer zoom range for capturing wildlife on safari. I understand that my budget might limit the image quality compared to higher-end cameras, but I\\'m hoping for something that offers noticeably better zoom and decent image quality for sharing photos from my trip.. Hi all, I’m looking to get my wife a compact zoom for her birthday. She primarily uses her phone and likes to play with the telephoto lenses on my EM5 iii and has expressed she wants something small, with good zoom, and a view finder to use for travel. She’s also mentioned that she wants to take higher quality photos than what her phone produces (iPhone 14). Trying not to break the bank and I keep coming back to the zs100 which I can get used for a little under $600 USD. Also looked at the rx100 but no view finder. Is this still a good buy in 2025? Any other recommendations below this price point that I haven’t noticed? Or should I just get her an iPhone 16 pro?.

Have a gen 1 canon 6d with the 24-105 lens and planning to do an extended trip in Europe (eg so lots of still photos vs moving). \\n\\nAlso planning to upgrade my iPhone to the iPhone 16.

Don’t want bogged down. Very reliable Strap, smallish bag but medium if needed \\n\\nCameras you\\'re considering: narrowed it down to mirrorless. I had a Nikon a long time ago - even before DSLR was a thing. Open to the major brands\\n\\nCameras you already have: iPhone 16 Pro. It’s fine for pictures but once you zoom in, quality just isn’t always there\\n\\nNotes: mostly for trip in hopes of getting great landscapes and wildlife. Mostly hobby. Doubt I’d do anything really “professional”.. hi i dont know much about photography and i wanted to know which is a good compact camera (travel) to start from, i wanted a compact camera that can take pictures better than the avarege iphone 15 16 series, can somebody guide me or list me a few options . For our business, we attend events where we take pictures. These pictures are sometimes published, but mostly posted on social media. Staff has iPhone (from work) that they use.\\n\\nHowever, we\\'d like to get a camera that\\'s a big better than what iPhone has. People taking pictures aren\\'t really photographers, so point-and-shoot.\\n\\n**Budget**: $1000 CAD, but can go over until $2k\\n\\n* **Country**: Canada\\n* **Condition**: New only\\n* **Type of Camera**: Digital, but otherwise flexible\\n* **Intended use**: Mostly photography, iPhone is good for videos\\n* **If photography; what style**: Indoor and outdoor people photography\\n* **What features do you absolutely need**: Idiot-proof great pictures and Zoom. I have Fujifilm x100vi (used to have the original and x100iv) and I like the recipes the camera has. But people taking pictures can\\'t use it because it\\'s too overwhelming for non-photographers (and it\\'s my personal one, the business won\\'t pay that much for the camera. Something that produces similar result with point-and-shoot that doesn\\'t require post-processing please.\\n* **What features would be nice to have**:\\xa0Good low-light photography because many events are indoors\\n* **Portability**: Not important.\\n* **Cameras you\\'re considering**: Sony DSC-RX100VII (it\\'s $1600, so I\\'ll have to go over budget but if it\\'s worth it then it\\'s fine).\\n\\n* **Cameras you already have**: Staff mostly uses iPhone. I have Fujifilm x100 but they found it overwhelming (I think they expect zoom)\\n* **Notes**: It\\'s one camera that will be used by 5-6 people (whoever is covering events that day).. I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice. I’ve been considering getting the new Lumix GH7 mirrorless camera. However, I haven’t upgraded my phone in years – I’m still using an iPhone XS Max.\\n\\nWith the iPhone 16 Pro Max coming out soon, I’m wondering if I should just upgrade my phone instead. I’m worried that the photo and video quality of the new iPhone might surpass or be only slightly less impressive compared to the Lumix GH7.\\n\\nFor context, I enjoy both photography and videography, and I want to make sure I’m investing in the right equipment. Another factor to consider is that the GH7 only has an MFT (Micro Four Thirds) sensor, which isn’t significantly larger than the 1-inch sensors found in many modern phone cameras. There\\'s also a possibility that the iPhone 16 Pro Max might have a sensor of the same size or even larger.\\n\\nAdditionally, what if future phone models, like the iPhone 18, eventually surpass the quality of the Lumix GH7 ? Would the camera be obsolete in only be about 2 years before it\\'s outperformed by the latest smartphones?\\n\\nWhat do you all think? Should I go for the dedicated mirrorless camera or just upgrade my phone? Any insights or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!\\n\\nThanks in advance!. Hi everyone I\\'ve been a micro four thirds user for the last ten years and I currently use a Panasonic GX85 and have a number of the lenses that cover everything including the 8-18mm, 12-35mm, 35-100mm, 17mm, 20mm, 25mm, 42.5mm, and a macro lens so I\\'m covered there.  The issue is that I\\'m not really using my gear anymore as I\\'m at a stage in life of raising kids and on the go constantly so getting out for photo walks or shoots is not really practical right now.  I\\'ve been considering selling my gear and going for a smaller or one compact camera setup.  I still want to take quality photos and I want to edit the raw files but also having the option for pre-edited JPG files or in camera film recipes is a great option too.  Am I just having GAS coveting the new releases with the built in film simulation options or would an update in gear be a good option for a shooter like me?

I need some help about choosing my first camera. I\\'m trying to get into photography, and I don\\'t know what camera brand is the best. For me, by looking in reviews and looking by some videos, maybe Canon or Sony, I am located in Bosnia, so cameras tend to be a bit pricier. There\\'s this site that is like Facebook marketplace but for Bosnia and I found three of these cameras and I need help choosing which one is the best. My needs are like casual photography, scooter shots, nature, travel, that kind of stuff. I was using my iPhone 14 Pro for like brand photography for a coffee shop and I would up my photography skills by buying a camera and learning with it so which will be the best choice from these three cameras  below.\\n\\ncanon eos 250d (kit lens 18-55), \\naround 2-5k shutter count\\ncanon eos 70d (50mm,18-55 kit lens,18-200mm)\\nsony alpha a77 mk2 (16-50 f/2.8,55-210)\\n. Hello!  I\\'m looking to buy a camera for my grandfather who is in his early 70s and has some computer experience.  I have no photography experience and don\\'t live close, but a relative is a professional photographer and may be able to occasionally help my grandfather (i\\'m not close enough to ask their opinion, but they are close with my grandfather). \\n\\nWhen I was visiting last year we went to the zoo and botanical gardens.  I gave my grandfather my smartphone, a Samsung s23 ultra, to use as a camera and he had a blast!  He drained my battery so much,  not just using the camera but also viewing the photos, that I had to keep a portable charger on me.  After transferring them to his email, i heard him up late into the night viewing the photos.  \\n\\nWould anyone have any recommendations as to what camera to buy for him?  I\\'d like for it to be a more \"professional\" camera.  My budget is roughly $1500 so I\\'m not sure if professional falls in to that price range.  \\n\\nMy grandparents are really special to me and they never treat themselves,  they really can\\'t as they\\'ve given so much to family.  I want to do for them now what they did for me as a child.. For context, I have an iPhone 16 pro max. \\n\\nI am looking for a camera (within TZ99/G100 price range) that is good for travel pictures and very compact. I also like the film/vintage vibes result without editing it (maybe I will learn to edit it in the future but for now, I want it to be a good result as is)\\n\\nCan u guys help me pls???. Here’s the questionnaire: \\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Budget: £500-£600???\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Country: China/Hong Kong/Thailand \\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Condition: Used (I definitely don’t think I’m gonna find what I’m looking for new? \\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Type of Camera: I’m not sure I think I want a mirrorless but based in my requirements described below this questionnaire, if you think theres a different type of camera which is better suited for my needs I can be convinced another way\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Intended use: Wildlife photography, amateur astrophotography, amateur event photography, travel videography \\n\\n•\\t\\u2060If photography; what style: I think I answered this above\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060If video what style: Mostly just capturing my travels, and I also like to do automotive content such as filming car meets and car edits as well\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060What features do you absolutely need: Good low light performance and fast shutter speed for the night safari’s where I can barely see anything, and also just a nice quality upgrade from my current camera (D5600)\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Portability: Fairly portable?

I’m looking to upgrade my D5600 simply because I just want better quality. I think I’ve had my fun with the D5600 but its time to step up now. I described my use case above but I’ll elaborate a bit more here: I’m ideally looking for a good hybrid camera, because currently I use my D5600 for photos and my iPhone 14 PM for videos, but working with content from my iPhone is frustrating - and even though the quality is amazing, I’m seeking something more now. Hence my consideration of the Sony A7 iii. I’ve seen content posted from the A7 iii and it just looks absolutely jaw dropping, there is so much range of tone and personality to its photos and videos, I love it and I know its a default camera for a lot of Youtubers and stuff as well, hence my immediate choice in it. \\n\\nI don’t actively follow the camera scene but from the bits I pick up here and there, this camera seems to be the king of doing it all and in my naive market research - I think they’re going for like £900-£1000 used? \\n\\nThis is where I need your expertise because I don’t even know if what I’m describing is possible - but my game plan is I would like to be able to trade in or sell my D5600, and then with that sale value I’m also willing to contribute up to £500 towards the A7 iii. I am heading on a trip to the east next week, first Bangkok, then Hong Kong and will do day trips from Hong Kong into Shenzhen and Guangzhou. \\nSo let me know:\\n\\n1. If these cities are a good place to go looking for cameras (I assume Bangkok isn’t gonna be as good as HK/SZ/GZ hence why I didn’t put it in the title)  - and which place would be the cheapest, my bet is probably on either SZ or GZ\\n\\n2. If its even possible to facilitate the type of transaction of sell/trade in D5600 and contribute balance in cash towards A7 iii\\n\\n3. Which markets/malls/districts would be best to go around and explore for this type of trade in deal I’m looking to complete \\n\\n4. If there are any other cameras on the market which could better suit my needs but are cheaper or less well known, I’m especially curious if the Chinese have done anything crazy in the camera department? They’ve shaken up the automotive industry, ecommerce, other consumer tech like mobile phones - have they done the same for cameras?\\n\\nAlso I had no idea what would be a good subreddit for this post, I hope this one isn’t too far off topic. If you know of a better subreddit that could provide better assistance, please let me know!\\n\\nThanks in advance r/Cameras - you’re the best! \\n \\n\\nEdit: If anybody knows of a Chinese camera forum as well where I could try and post this, please also let me know! I’m sure the locals will probably have some really good advice to share as well :) \\n\\nUpdate 1: To those of you who are likely considering the same thing in the future, this is the knowledge I\\'ve gathered so far in my research:\\n\\nHong Kong is likely the better place to look at getting any sort of gear then China or Guangzhou/Shenzhen would be. This is because of the duty free. Also likely a safer purchase then in China due to Hong Kong being more reputable and not selling as many \"Fakes\". You can also use a tool called price.com.hk to check the prices of whatever item you would like to purchase from a lot of vendors in the city. You can see what authorised or \"official\" prices are as well as parallel import prices which are cheaper but likely do not come with a warranty.\\n\\nI\\'ve also recently learned of the Nikon Z5 II, which released conveniently in the last 4 days, and is in the same price bracket new that I was hoping to spend on the A7 iii used (at least according to price.com.hk), so I shall be hunting for that when I arrive in HK.\\n\\nI wanna give a special thank you to u/NeverEndingDClock and u/notcool_5354 for all of your assistance, it was incredibly helpful and I really really appreciate it!\\n\\nI shall update this one more time if I manage to successfully hunt down a Z5 II in HK ^_^. Hey guys! I need some help from the experts moving forward in finding the right camera for me. I\\'ve always wanted to purchase a GoPro or DJI as I want to create more underwater and adventure content... However, I\\'ve also recently been searching and researching a good hybrid camera that I can use for just everyday picture and video, as well as for a new project I\\'ll be working on. This is my current priority and it seems like a regular mirrorless camera would be a much better fit for this over an action camera and that I\\'ll be able to get much more use out of it. For this project specifically, I need a camera that can just record decent footage while sitting down and talking. It either has to have good enough sound quality that I can record talking outside, or be able to easily pair with my yeti microphone. I don\\'t need anything super fancy but I\\'m willing to spend if a camera really has all the features I want and will mean I don\\'t have to go an purchase a whole other camera for other purposes.\\n\\n* **Budget**: cheaper is obviously better but I\\'m willing to spend up to like 700 CAD for the right camera (still flexible, as previously stated)\\n* **Country**: Canada\\n* **Condition**: new or can be used if from a trustworthy source\\n* **Type of Camera**: mirrorless or action\\n* **Intended use**: hybrid shooting\\n* **If photography; what style**: various. mostly pictures with friends, travel, scenery, etc.\\n* **If video what style**: vlogging/content creation, as well as just artistic lifestyle, action/adventure content if suitable\\n* **What features do you absolutely need**: must have good automatic settings or be very straightforward/user friendly\\n* **What features would be nice to have**: would preferably want a viewfinder and good sound quality or be able to connect to a microphone. if I\\'m spending on the higher end, would be nice if it was waterproof\\n* **Portability**: How portable does it need to be? fit into a small bag/purse\\n* **Cameras you\\'re considering**: KODAK PIXPRO FZ55-BK (seems like a good basic hybrid camera at an ideal price point, have heard that it\\'s no better than an iphone camera, not sure how great it is for video), SONY ZV-1F (really like the viewfinder and the high quality video, heard that it doesn\\'t have great automatic settings, at the high end of my budget, not sure if it\\'s great for pictures), gopro/dji (great for action content but doesn\\'t seem as suitable for everyday picture and video as well as sit-down vlog style videos)\\n* **Cameras you already have**: just my iphone 16 and some super basic film cameras. maybe I just don\\'t know how to work my phone camera well but I often just don\\'t like the look/quality of my pictures and videos and find it\\'s hard to get good front camera videos in certain lighting. also have had difficulty trying to hook it up to my yeti microphone\\n* **Notes**: (any other considerations you think we should know about) I\\'m a basic gal, I like that kind of rough/nostalgic look to digital photos/videos, as long as I\\'m not limited to bad quality video and sound\\n\\nI\\'m aware I\\'m looking for a lot in a smaller budget, which is why I\\'m happy to just get a decent digital camera for everyday picture and video. But let me know what you guys think! Thank you in advance. * **Budget**: 300 USD\\n* **Country**: USA\\n* **Condition**: Either, however I think that **used** would be better considering my small budget\\n* **Type of Camera**: After doing some research, **DSLR** seems like the best one, however I am open to anything.\\n* **Intended use**: Mostly **photography**, but maybe a bit of video\\n* **If photography; what style**: Landscape, general life around me\\n* **If video what style**: N/A\\n* **What features do you absolutely need**: Easy to use, good **quality** photos.\\n* **What features would be nice to have**: Good low-light performace and battery life.\\n* **Portability**: Shoulder strap / small bag, however this isn\\'t that important\\n* **Cameras you\\'re considering**: \\n   * Nikon D3400: Found a few really good options for cheap.

I love the film look, but dealing with film rolls while on the move is just a headache now—and the cost of buying and developing film is getting out of hand. I’m looking for a digital alternative that can deliver film-like photos without the hassle.\\n\\nThis will be my everyday carry. I work with high-end supercars and would love to capture great shots of them—both detail shots and dynamic lifestyle ones. But I also find myself at the beach or in the mountains after work, so I need something that can handle both polished and rugged environments.\\n\\nFlash is a bonus, and while it’ll mostly be for stills, solid video would be great too.

UPDATE:\\n\\nThey have finally now refunded me, after a lot of frustrating emails a external fraud security team accepted that it was not scanned after being passed from their warehouse to the courier. They accepted the claim and will send a refund.\\n\\nThis is my first experience dealing with MPB and while I would normally buy used to save a bit, I feel as their T&Cs are a bit dodgy and by offloading the blame onto the buyer rather than themselves I am going to avoid buying from them in the future, sorry MPB..\\n\\n\\n\\nHi guys.\\n\\nI am looking for some advice on what to do.\\n\\nI purchased a 27MM Fuji prime lens from MPB UK on the 10/03. They sent a follow up email saying they dispatched it later that day, which included a tracking number.\\n\\nThe courier is Evri and for those of you not in the UK, just to fill you in they are famously terrible for reliability. I checked back in every day to see when they expected it would be delivered. As of the 18/03 it still says they are expecting the package from the seller.\\n\\nI have had experiences sometimes with their tracking being quite slow to update and being stuck at depots for a while etc. But this one didn\\'t seem right. I emailed MPB on the 16/03 and they looked into it, they found that their dispatch team had sent it out to Evri and the thinking is that it has been stolen or gone missing.\\n\\nBecause I was a bit late in getting back to them, they have told me that they can\\'t open a claim for me and that I need to contact my local authorities. I am truly lost with what to do, I can\\'t contact Evri as their automated bot won\\'t let me get in touch with anyone as the parcel is still apparently with the seller.\\n\\nFor those of you interested here is their response:\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\nI have reached out to our Dispatch team regarding this, who confirmed that this was dispatched, and passed to EVRi on 10/03/25.\\n\\nHowever, according to the courier\\'s records, we are beyond the timeframe for initiating a successful investigation.\\n\\n\\ufeffAs outlined in our Terms and Conditions, we do need to be contacted within 5 calendar days regarding any lost or damaged items. This process is clearly outlined in our Terms and Conditions, as well as our online Help Articles.\\n\\n\\ufeff\\u200b\\ufeff\\ufeffAt this time, we strongly advise pursuing an investigation with your local authorities, as the item may have been stolen. We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused and please do not hesitate to reach out if you require further assistance\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\nAny advise is much appreciated!!. Trying to decide between the two.  Used Canon DSLR in the past but body is 15 years old and looking for something smaller for travel that takes better images and has a better feel than the iPhone 16 pro.  I tend to like wide angle landscape shots but also an occasional portrait.  I know I’ll have to pay a premium if I want to get the Fuji currently. It seems like the Leica is a plus because of the zoom lens but the Fuji has a better sensor. I like the look of the Fuji but the Leica also looks good. . Hi all. Apologies if this is already answered but I\\'ve not found found anything that specifically covers this scenario. I\\'m not a beginner (despite what the quality of my output might look like), but am a hobbyist. I\\'m now wedded to the idea of the below focal range as my one and done lens. I\\'ve become increasingly lazy with having to change prime lenses and know this kind of focal range will be exactly what I want.\\n\\nI\\'m looking at an a6700 (seemingly like everyone else). I was looking at the Sigma 18-50 2.8 but in the interests of getting it right first time and not wishing I\\'d got it in the first place I was considering the Sony 16-55 2.8 for that extra bit of sharpness, range and weather sealing etc. \\n\\nThe grey market prices seem to good to be true and after some digging around it seems for the a6700 in the UK theres an issue where the firmware is locked to NTSC vs PAL for video. From what I can see the importers have hacked the firmware or something to get around this, however when people have updated firmware that setting has reverted. Given that I\\'m prepared to (grudgingly) pay full whack for the body.\\n\\nThe lenses however I\\'m struggling to see where there could be any potential gotchas in the same way. For instance it seems a couple of reputable grey market sellers are doing it for £750. Going rate used seems to be £850 and brand new £950. \\n\\nObviously this is still more expensive than the Sigma but it\\'s at the price point to me that it starts to feel less ridiculous picking the Sony over the Sigma. \\n\\nGet to the point!: Am I opening myself up to a load of potential problems buying the lens grey market? What am I missing?\\n\\nAny help thoughts much appreciated :). Hello!\\n\\nI am looking for a camera for my 16 year old interested in digital photography,specifically of insects. Here is the questionnaire:\\n\\nBudget: around 400?\\nCountry: United States\\nCondition: used .

I would appreciate the ability to record some short videos, but not a must at this point. Basically looking for something versatile that would help me capture catalog photos.\\n\\nThe Sony A6000 appears to be in very good condition and comes with a 16-50mm zoom lens.\\n\\nCanon Rebel T7 is new from best buy and comes with a 18-88mm lens. Can upgrade to also include an EF75-300 lens for a total of $699.\\n\\nMost of my photography will be during the day in optimal conditions, except for interior shots. I would appreciate any feedback, especially if you own either camera and want to share your experiences.\\n\\nQuestionnaire:\\n\\n* **Budget**: $700 (USD)\\n* **Country**: USA\\n* **Condition**: New or Used - best value\\n* **Type of Camera**: Mirrorless, DSLR\\n* **Intended use**: 80% Photography, 20% Video\\n* **If photography; what style**: Product photography - boats, lifestyle shots\\n* **If video what style**: unsure\\n* **What features do you absolutely need**: image quality!\\n* **What features would be nice to have**:\\n* **Portability**: Does not need to be portable\\n* **Cameras you\\'re considering**: See above\\n* **Cameras you already have**: iPhone 15 Pro, not enough depth to photos. Hi, I’m a girl who hardly knows anything about camera stuff, so this would be my first camera. I\\'m graduating in a few months, so I think a camera would help me capture beautiful moments better than my phone can. (My phone is an iPhone 11, which isn’t as new as the iPhone 15/16 Pro, so the quality isn’t really good.)\\n\\nI\\'ve been looking for something that\\'s not too bulky, affordable, has a flip-up screen & built-in flash, can film 4K video, and focuses fast.\\n\\nI searched for bit and I\\'m leaning toward a fixed-lens camera since I don\\'t want to deal with the cost of separate lenses like they can be quite pricey 😭. The Lumix LX10 caught my eye at first, and I really liked it until I realized it’s hard to find and overpriced in my country. Then I found the Sony RX100 II at a decent price but it aint has a flip screen for selfies. I thought about using the UURig RO31 selfie flip screen as a solution, but my guy friend mentioned that it might be too bulky, I still think it’s a creative and helpful solution tho.\\n\\nSo my guy friend, with more camera experience, and he recommended the Olympus E-PL9. In the same price range, I found the GX85, which doesn\\'t have a limit record time for 4K, but the E-PL9 has Bluetooth and a built-in flip screen, so I\\'m torn. (Also if I buying cameras with interchangeable lens, I guess I could only afford kit lenses…)\\n\\nI’m wondering which one would be better for me: the GX85 or the E-PL9 (similar price) or the RX100 II (about $80 cheaper)? \\n\\nFor personal preference, I would say if I I buy a camera, I’ll mostly use it for selfies and filming myself. I\\'m really interested in 4K video but need reliable autofocus, and I hope my camera maintains its value. Also, I’ve heard that Sony\\'s settings can be complex, but I\\'ve seen many girls on TikTok who make it work.\\n\\nAccording to my guy friend, the E-PL9 takes better photos than the GX85 and has superior filters. He also mentioned that 1” sensor cameras might not be worth it since newer phone cameras might perform just as well.\\n\\nI’m new to all this and feeling a bit confused, so I’d appreciate any advice, explanations, or experiences you can share. Thanks a lot!\\n. I am preparing for a multi-day hiking trip across Scotland this March and I\\'m hoping to make an effort of putting more thought into some better looking images (I am a \"big camera\" noob, but I do enjoy taking pics with my iPhone).\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll be taking my iPhone 16 Pro Max on the trip with me, but I have access to two other cameras which I can take. The problem is, I don\\'t know anything about them and their pro\\'s and con\\'s relative to the other.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cameras I have are a \\'Olympus E-PL8 With a 14-42mm lens and a 40-150mm lens\\' and a seemingly much older \\'Sony A300 with a 18-70mm lens\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nDo these cameras even hold up against the camera in my iPhone? Should I just take the iPhone? Whats the advantages of them both? I\\'d love to get some thoughts.. Hi there,\\n\\nCan you please recommend a camera for my trip overseas, given my current cameras owned already?\\n\\nPlease see the completed questionnaire below:\\n\\n* **Budget**: $500\\\\~$1,400 USD\\n* **Country**: USA\\n* **Condition**: New preferred\\n* **Type of Camera**: Point and shoot\\n* **Intended use**: Photography and/or hybrid\\n* **If photography; what style**: Family photos > Landscape > Portrait > Wildlife, flowers, etc\\n* **If video what style**: Vlogging\\n* **What features do you absolutely need**:  (1) More lightweight and compact than A6700+18-50MM Sigma Lens and (2) Better photo quality than my iPhone 12 Pro (12MP)\\n* **What features would be nice to have**: Decent or good low light performance\\n* **Portability**: Very portable, please.\\n\\n**Cameras you already have**:\\n\\n* **DJI POCKET 3** (Likes: Stabilization, portability; Disilkes: Photos are only 9MP, battery life) +\\n* **SONY A6700** with **18-50mm Sigma lens** (Likes: Great picture quality, video quality, nice zoom; Dislikes: Weight of the configuration, tight fit into my handbag for travel, not as good stabilization unless using a gimbal with it)\\n* **FX30** (Likes: built-in fan for longer filming sessions; Dislikes: size)\\n\\n**Cameras you\\'re considering**:\\n\\n* **Sony ZV-1 ii** (form factor, can be used as a back-up video camera);\\n* **Sony RX100VII** (it was recommended to me by redditors to me!; 200mm range);\\n* **Ricoh GR IIIx** (I see this frequently recommended on reddit as well)\\n* ALTERNATIVELY: **Buy Kit Lens (16-50mm) from Sony and try to bring A6700** \\\\- deal with the weight because at least it is more compact than A6700+Sigma Lens. The 18-50mm lens from Sigma is very large. The Kit Lens seem to be a quarter of the size.\\n\\n**Notes**:\\n\\nI will be taking DJI POCKET 3 with +1 camera.\\n\\nDJI for video purposes.\\n\\nI\\'m hoping the new camera would be the go-to for photography, and perhaps (but not required) used as a back-up camera for video captures.\\n\\nAlthough many photographers and hobbyists like myself find A6700 on the lighter end, I found it a bit too heavy for me. I will need to take this camera everywhere I go while overseas, in a shoulder / cross-body bag with many other items. It would be amazing if I could get a device that is compact (portable) and weighs less than 300-400g. I believe my current setup with the A6700+Sigma Lens are about 600-800g -- a bit too heavy for me. It also takes up almost half my bag space.\\n\\nThank you for reading and I\\'d really appreciate your insights on cameras.. I recently used an iPhone 16 to take a few snapshots, and it looked amazing—sharp, well-edited, natural, and full of detail, even at telephoto. I had my OM-5 with me, and couldn\\'t match the iPhone\\'s results. It was frustrating because my camera has a bigger sensor and better lens, yet the phone easily outperformed it.\\n\\nSmartphones are simple: no worrying about exposure, iso, depth of field, shutter speed, or dynamic range. AI handles it all—noise reduction, highlight/shadow balance—using just three tiny sensors and powerful software.\\n\\nMeanwhile, my camera often gives me flat, noisy shots that require 20 minutes in Lightroom to match what a phone does in seconds. I enjoy using a real camera with manual controls, but it\\'s hard to love photography when it\\'s so much work compared to a smartphone.\\n\\nPeople say phone shots are oversaturated and don’t hold up on bigger screens, but that’s outdated. AI in smartphones is improving fast, and giving users more control over editing, even in-camera. Why spend hours in Lightroom when your phone can deliver near-professional results with creative options like presets and LUTs?\\n\\nCameras should easily beat phones, but they don\\'t leverage the tech available—like AI driven hdr, AI denoise, or advanced scene detection. There\\'s no reason why my camera shouldn\\'t be able to do what my phone does. I\\'m tired of needing a P.hd in optimal exposure and buying better lenses just to keep up with my phone. . •\\t\\u2060Budget:600-850\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Country: USA\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Condition: Used \\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Type of Camera: Not sure\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Intended use: Mainly Sports photography but also street and nature \\n\\n•\\t\\u2060If photography; what style: listed above\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060If video what style: sport maybe\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060What features do you absolutely need: not sure\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Portability: Dont care\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Cameras you\\'re considering: Canon 80d and Sony A6100\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Cameras you already have: iPhone 16\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Notes: I am a complete beginner looking to do photography and maybe some videography. I am 15 in highschool and mainly plan on doing highschool sports both indoor and outdoor. I also want to do photography for other things like nature and street photography. I would say my budget for is around 600-850 usd for camera body and all around lens to start out with before getting a better lens for sports photography in the future. I have been doing lots of research and have been recommended cameras such as the Canon 80d and the Sony A6100 and I was wondering if one of these are good starters or if there are any better ones that you guys would recommend\\n. I found nikon d5000 (18-55m 3.5-5.6f) some days ago, and tried to compare it with my iphone 12 pro. I can see that nikon’s photos are better but i can’t understand why. And it’s seems strange to me that 16 y.o camera is better than not as old phone. Can someone explain something to me? (btw there is some photos i made)\\n\\np.s. Is my old nikon still okay?. \\nBudget: Around £400\\nCountry: UK\\nCondition: New or used (open to both)\\nType of Camera: Mirrorless or compact camera with good video capabilities\\nIntended use: Video (filming beauty/skincare content for Instagram & TikTok)\\nIf video, what style: Vlogging, product shots, tutorials\\n\\nWhat features do you absolutely need?\\n\\t•\\t4K video quality\\n\\t•\\tAbility to film vertically\\n\\t•\\tA flip screen so I can see myself while recording\\n\\t•\\tGood autofocus and color accuracy\\n\\t•\\tDecent low-light performance\\n\\nWhat features would be nice to have?\\n\\t•\\tGood built-in stabilization\\n\\t•\\tLightweight and easy to use\\n\\t•\\tExternal mic input for better audio\\n\\nPortability: Small enough to be easy to set up and use for content creation but doesn’t need to be ultra-compact.\\n\\nCameras you’re considering: I was thinking about getting the iPhone 16 Pro, but I’m also looking at cameras like the Sony ZV-1 or Canon G7X III.

Thanks in advance.. **Budget:** $1300 before tax (have some more money for tax set aside\\n\\n**Country:** United States\\n\\n**Condition:** Good with either new or used\\n\\n**Type of Camera:** Mirrorless\\n\\n**Intended use:** Hybrid shooting\\n\\n**If photography; what style:** Street, portraits candid, landscape, and some astrophotography\\n\\n**If video what style:** Cinematic mini-stories, story-driven narrative type vlogs, kind of...? Note sure the best name for it.   \\nSome creators whose styles I like for example of what I want to do: Keo Tsang, Chris Broad (Abroad in Japan), Tokyo Lens, and Wulffden (he does more device reviews, but really like his camera work)\\n\\n**What features do you absolutely need:** Articulating screen, weather sealing on the body\\n\\n**What features would be nice to have:** Really good autofocus\\n\\n**Portability:** Fairly portable to where it would be pretty easy to carry around in a 20L bag most normal days, or a \\\\~6L sling bag. \\n\\n**Cameras you\\'re considering:** Sony a6700, Lumix S5ii\\n\\n**Cameras you already have:** Had a Lumix G85, but I\\'ve sold it earlier in the year to fund a nicer camera. It was a bit underwhelming for video and photo, but still alright, and wanted an upgrade. \\n\\n**Notes:**   \\nI originally ordered a new Sony a6700 (only $20 more than used with my education discount) but then realized I could get a used Lumix S5ii in excellent condition for just $32 more. A new S5ii would be about $130 more with discounts. Returning the a6700 would mean paying return shipping, but it wouldn\\'t be that much.\\n\\nI’ve used the a6700 quite a bit, borrowing one from my university (24-hour max rentals), so I’m very familiar with it. I previously had a Lumix G85 but sold it earlier this year to upgrade. I like Sony’s menus but haven’t used newer Lumix models, so I’m not as familiar with their system.\\n\\nIf I keep the a6700, I’ll start with the Tamron 17-70mm and later add the 11-20mm, mostly looking at used/open-box lenses. If I go with the S5ii, I’d get the Sigma 24-70mm Contemporary and 16-28mm Contemporary. Ideally, I’d prefer the Sigma 24-70mm II Art and 14-24mm Art for their weather sealing, but they’re significantly more expensive, but I\\'d be happy using the contemporary lenses until I can upgrade down the road.\\n\\nI\\'m torn because the a6700 has better autofocus, a bit cheaper lenses for what ones I\\'m looking at, and is more compact, while the S5ii offers full-frame, better low-light performance, much better image stabilitaztion, color science and luts for photo and video, and better cooling and video features. \\n\\nBiggest concerns with the S5ii:\\n\\n* **Portability** – larger and heavier than the a6700.\\n* **Autofocus** – I’ve heard it still struggles a bit with mist/ND filters and in low light, even after the more recent update. \\n* **Moiré issues** – no OLPF, but I\\'m not sure if this would affect the a6700 at all. \\n* **Rolling shutter & mic buzz issues** – have read some users report these.\\n* **More expensive lenses** – but better low-light tradeoff.\\n* **HDMI lag** – turning off audio over HDMI helps somewhat.\\n\\nWhat I like about the a6700:\\n\\n* **Better portability, cheaper lenses, excellent autofocus, better rolling shutter.**\\n* **4K 120fps & no crop in 4K 60fps.** however I\\'ll be shooting 4k 30fps, or 24fps most the time. \\n* **USB-C webcam function** – useful since I stream occasionally.\\n* **Downsides:** Potential overheating, micro HDMI is annoying, and low-light performance being not as good. Only preview LUTs for video only, IBIS not as good as Lumix. \\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nI got to hold an a7 IV with a Sigma 24-70 II today (since local to me there aren\\'t any Lumix in stores, or at my University) and the size isn\\'t that bad actually. There are still some benefits for the a6700 portability, but it\\'s not as bad as I thought either. . I learnt photography basics at school when I was 17, and 18 years later I would really like to forgo the smartphone camera and get back into photography with a dedicated device.\\n\\nAt first I just wanted something very pocketable with a high zoom so I had the Cannon SX740HS on backorder for 6 months but they couldn’t fulfil my order, so cancelled it. \\n\\nOn a whim last week I purchased TZ99 as it seemed the next best thing. I’ve had a great week taking pictures and getting used to the various settings etc. I do love the pocketability but I’m also having some buyers remorse.\\n\\nThe photos are noticeably better than my iPhone 16 pro max but I wonder if I should return it for the G100D.\\n\\nWould there be noticeable difference in quality straight out of the box?\\n\\nI’m UK based. The G100 is £549 at the moment, and I really wouldn’t like to pay anymore than that.\\n\\nI don’t really want to complicate things and look at other models. I think the G100 would be great for travel, street photography etc. I just want to know if it’s much better than the TZ99.\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\nJust in case it’s needed:\\n\\n•\\t\\u2060Budget: £550\\n•\\t\\u2060Country: UK\\n•\\t\\u2060Condition: New\\n•\\t\\u2060Type of Camera: Pocketable!

I\\'m willing to drop $2k on a camera, but if you think that\\'s too much for a beginner, I\\'m open to other recommendations.\\n\\n...But, again, it has to be through Best Buy, and these are just the cameras listed as their \"Black Friday\" deals.\\n\\nAny help appreciated!!

Has anyone ever tried this and has some tips for me is it worth it? Especially with my lens being in okay condition when I can just buy one in very good condition and sell mine for like 40€ difference 😬\\n\\nUpdate 1: I found a temporary fix by tying a cloth around the lens 👍\\nAnd I found an [IFIXIT Guide](https://de.ifixit.com/Anleitung/Repairing+Sigma+8-16+mm+lens/44742) for a different lens that should align enough..

However, I am mainly looking for a good travel camera for an upcoming 2-week trip to Japan. For reference, this trip is not for another 3-4 months but I am still in school without a job at the moment, and this is a relatively budget trip with 3 buddies of mine. Hence the low budget for the camera. For the most part, I want to be able to take quality pictures of landscapes, temples, wildlife, street life, etc. while I’m there with maybe 1 or 2 extra batteries on me.

Hi y’all! I’m looking for a nice camera that won’t break my bank (too bad). For context, I have an iPhone 14Pro and my pictures turn out pretty great there and I’ve taken photography and videography classes throughout college (I was able to rent dslr cameras). I’m hoping for a camera that can level me up, if you will, and has video capabilities. I’m at an advanced beginner stage lol But I my style is kind of lifestyle with a documentary flair. From what I’ve read online, I’ve come to these two cameras (pictured). What do yall think? \\n\\nThank you!🤠. Budget: Low cost ($80-$150 AUD)\\n\\nCountry: Australia\\n\\nCondition: Used/ Second Hand only\\n\\nType of Camera: No preference \\n\\nIntended use: Everyday photography & Video\\n\\nIf photography; what style: Landscape & Portrait\\n\\nIf video what style: Everyday/ Casual use\\n\\nWhat features do you absolutely need: Storage, easy transfer to phone\\n\\nWhat features would be nice to have: Clear photo quality, high quality image\\n\\nPortability: Pocket to Short strap \\n\\nCameras you\\'re considering: None yet; will update\\n\\nCameras you already have: Phone camera lol, very poor quality (Samsung a13)\\n\\nNotes: I always have to ask my friends to send me the photos they took on their iphones because my photos taken on my Samsung a13 are so awful. Looking for a relatively cheap camera with clear quality for just travel photos and posts. Just like a small digital camera for taking photos with friends, bird sightings etc. \\n\\nThanks!. Hello Camera Reddit,\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I (both 23) are going on a year long round world trip. We want to be able to take nice photos and videos of us and our surroundings to look back on, as it\\'s the last time we can truly travel before starting medical residency (those who know, know). I would really appreciate some help as I am truly a beginner outside of iPhone photography. I really want to learn more about cameras and I think this is an excellent point to buy a versatile one that can sustain our trip.\\n\\nHere\\'s the filled out questionnaire:\\n\\n* **Budget**: 1000 euros\\n* **Country**: The Netherlands, though our first stop is Miami. We have a 24 hour layover at a friends\\' house so we could pick something up there. Though I prefer already having it here so I can practice and learn :)\\n* **Condition**: New and used, preferably used obviously as it allows us to squeeze a little more quality for our buck.\\n* **Type of Camera**: Digital camera, don\\'t know the difference between all the suggested ones.\\n* **Intended use**: Photography, but I\\'d like to take vlog style videos (i.e. walking through the mountains, street food at night in a city, maybe a cutesie video to send our loves ones)\\n* **If photography; what style**: Not necessarily landscape, but landscapes will be photographed. As will humans.\\n* **If video what style**: I suppose a cross section between vlog and documentary?\\n* **What features do you absolutely need**: It will be a roundworld trip in lots of different climates (patagonia, SE asia) and we will be one bagging <35 L (r/OneBag). It is necessary that the camera is sturdy and not too clunky.\\n* **Portability**: Small bag?\\n* **Cameras you\\'re considering**: I am considering a secondhand Sony a6600, as the body here is around 700-800 euros. I read that it\\'s all around a good camera, though I am having doubts as the video quality seems subpar to my iphone (only reference point).\\n* **Cameras you already have**: I have a Canon AE-1 which is a film camera. What I like about it is that it\\'s sturdy and not huge. Also relatively easy to use.\\n* **Notes**: I would also like to be adviced a good lens, preferably within the 1000 euros budget to go with the sony/other camera that is suitable for the round world trip. Again I am an extreme noob but I want to learn so bad before I go, I think 1 lens is enough to capture us/everything as it is more about having clear/crisp memories that I can always colorcorrect etc, than having the prettiest shot.\\n\\nVideos I want to take example,s: Basically just nice crispy shots. idk if that sony that I wrote about can do it.\\n\\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/C\\\\_\\\\_BK1JM6i4/](https://www.instagram.com/p/C__BK1JM6i4/)\\n\\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/C-t94kKIqG7/](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-t94kKIqG7/)\\n\\n. I was about to purchase the Canon Sx740hs when I saw a tiktok video about how sx740 can get blurry in terms of quality so she had to purchase the Canon G7x instead. A lot of comments agreed and mentioned how Sony RX100 is even better than both Canon Sx and G7x. It is my first time hearing about Sony RX100 and I have set my mind to Canon at first as those two were the most popular.\\n\\nG7x is definitely out of my budget but I can probably stretch my budget out to Sony RX100 III, IV or V\\n\\nDo you have any insight on which one\\'s better for me? I will use it mainly for leisure, instagram and such. I don\\'t go to concerts a lot, I also have an Iphone 16 Pro Max but would rather use a camera for my leisure and travel. This will be my first time owning a camera so it\\'s hard for me to decide which one will be better for me cost and quality-wise.\\n\\nThank you for your input, I appreciate it!. Budget: under $1500 Country: Canada Condition: any Type of Camera: compact point and shoot\\nIntended use: travel, nature, nightlife If photography; what style: landscape and portrait If video what style: n/a What features do you absolutely need: portability (able to fit in pocket), good flash, high photo quality, good zoom Portability: small compact point and shoot Cameras you\\'re considering: canon sx740 hs, Panasonic Lumix Ix100 ii, canon g/x Cameras you already have: n/a\\n\\nNotes: I\\'m looking for a versatile point and shoot compact digital camera that would be good to bring to Europe. I want to take high quality pictures of the city. I don\\'t like my iPhone 12 mainly because of the zoom but also my photos never turn out the way I like.\\n\\nI\\'ve considered the Sony rx100s but the photos seem to look slightly too professional and I want something that looks more natural. What are your thoughts on the canon sx740 hs and the Panasonic Lumix Ix100 lI? Are these also good for nightlife portraits with flash? What other cameras would you recommend? I like the vibe of the Fuji films too but are there any of them that look a little less filtered?. Budget:1000-1500 euros \\nCountry: Croatia\\nCondition: can be used or new \\nType of Camera: Mirrorless\\nPhotography : Taking photos while traveling, geting into professional photography and night photography \\nVideo: same as photography \\nPortability: Not to big and heavy\\nCameras that I’m considering buying : \\nSony A7 III, Sony A6700, Sony A6400, Fujifilm X-T3, Canon R10, Canon R50\\n\\nLenses: what lenses i should buy as a beginner \\nAccessories for beginners : what to buy first and then later on \\n\\nI already own iPhone 16 Pro and I’m considering to sell and spend some of the money on a new camera. What would you suggest its the smartest decision for me. \\n\\nThanks for everyone who helps and replies <3. Hobby photographer with basic photography knowledge. I’m eyeballing this camera mainly for its aesthetics. I already have a Nikon D7500, but  it’s heavy and I only carry it with me when I’m on vacation and want to get nicer pictures than my iPhone will take. Is this Nikon Z a significant step up from a D7500 or just the mirrorless version of it? Any pros and cons would also be appreciated. . UPDATE: Sony it is! \\n\\nI know this has been asked a million times but in a different situation than usual. \\n\\nTL;DR. Sell A6400 + Sigma 30mm for a R50 or R10 with two kit lenses? \\n\\nI had a Nikon D3300 up until recently when I got A6400 used with 16-50mm lit lens and a Sigma 30mm which I loveeee!! \\n\\nBut I held a Canon camera finally in hand I love the grip on it and the articulating display. Only thing is that the body feels cheap because of plastic rather than alloy I’m used to with A6400. But not a deal breaker. I don’t mind the menu on Sony but less complex Canon menu makes me anxious if it’s missing any settings that Sony would have? \\n\\nBiggest complaint with Sony is that slow buffers from burst mode and HORRIFYING APPS! Sony wouldn’t even let me login to my website account when I lost the password! \\n\\nI tried autofocus etc and deff like Canon better there. Also pink problem? Wow not an issue on Canon. \\n\\nFor background, I’m a casual shooter and recently got married so traveling will be more frequent so portability is a must. \\n\\nShould I do switch while I’m ahead without investing a ton in the lens? \\n\\nCurrent setup; A6400, 16-50mm Sony kit lens and Sigma 30mm f/1.4 Contemporary (Cost me about $850 used)\\n\\nSetup I’m looking at: R50, two kit Canon lenses and a manual 28mm lens for $750\\n\\nOr R10 used on MPB/eBay and get prime and a kit lens? Probably around $800-900 then\\n\\nAll within my budget. . Hi everyone,\\n\\nI’m looking for a lens upgrade for my Sony A6000. I currently have the Sony E 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS, but I feel it’s limiting me, and I’d like to improve my image quality—especially compared to the iPhone 16.\\n\\nI use my camera mainly for travel photography, documenting landscapes, people, and animals in different lighting conditions. I’d love a lens that significantly improves sharpness, low-light performance, and overall image quality.\\n\\nMy budget is €500 or less (cheaper is better). I’d appreciate any recommendations!\\n\\nThanks in advance!. I am a beginner with basic, minimal manual photography experience from high school who wants to take up photography as a hobby for vacation and camping trips, mostly. \\n\\nI love taking photos of landscapes, some wildlife, plants, and candid shots of people and lifestyle scenes. I would value size and weight as important criteria as I would like to take this camera on moderate hikes and even backpacking trips. Ideally I can find a kit (camera body with one or two extra lenses of different capability) that will allow me to grow from automatic dependence to confidence in manual operation. In other words, an entry level camera that still allows me to grow into its real capabilities.\\n\\nBudget: $1000, but if I can get away with much less and be happy as a beginner, great. However I know this is an expensive hobby to break into.   \\n\\nCountry: USA\\n\\nCondition: new or used\\n\\nType: would love to go mirrorless for the sake of high tech but with my beginner experience level and budget I would happily settle for DSLR\\n\\nIntended Use: mainly photography, but if possible to combine with video capability, sure! (not essential but would be a plus for making basic videos)\\n\\nStyle: hobbyist – take my camera on camping trips, hikes, vacations, everyday interesting capture for fun. Video would be for basic youtube vlogs or interviews (but again, the video is just an extra, not a requirement). I think if I had to prioritize type of photo while on the trail, it would be capturing landscapes, vistas, and plants – not the extreme detail of a raptor perched at the top of a distant pine tree or a deer 75 yards away. I reeeally don’t think I’m ready for that advanced wildlife photography with huge lenses. But maybe one day!\\n\\nWhat features I absolutely need: unsure, but a device that is durable and weather resistant with a relatively compact body (for portability) with interchangeable lenses would be great.\\n\\nPortability: portability is a high consideration. I have in mind a camera that can do both fully automated and full manual modes, while still being overall on the small side. I would like to easily be able to put it in a small bag, backpack, or keep hanging around my neck/shoulder without being an absolute tank.\\n\\nCameras I’m considering: (I have read from other threads these are somewhat compact, suitable for beginners, etc)\\n\\nCanon EOS M50\\n\\nCanon R50 or R10\\n\\nSony A6000 series\\n\\nNikon Z50\\n\\n Cameras I already have - probably not relevant here?: iPhone 16 Pro, GoPro 12, old Sony DSC-H200 I found in storage which feels sort of like a cheap plastic toy and I never really use.\\n\\n \\n\\nAs a noob, please check me if any of my expectations or desires do not jive with reality. Thanks!. For travel, I like to use a mix of cameras.  During the day when sightseeing, I bring my Nikon D3300.  I will also use my iPhone for quick photos when I want to use geotagging for location.  Last year, I borrowed my father\\'s Sony DSC-HX99, which was great for pictures better than the iPhone, but also much more compact than the Nikon D3300.  I used the Sony at night when we were out on the town, and I didn\\'t want to drag around the DSLR and again, wanted photos that are better than anything I can get with an iPhone.\\n\\nWe are headed on a trip again, and unfortunately the Sony has died, and I\\'m looking for a compact camera that I can put in a jacket pocket to take good shots when out and about at night.  \\n\\nI like Nikon, and it seems like the Nikon Z50 may fit my needs.  I am specifically looking for a mirrorless camera that has a built-in flash.  I know I\\'m compromising here, but since I have the D3300 for my sightseeing photos, I\\'m ok with the loss of quality with a built-in flash since ultimately, I want a compact camera that takes better photos than an iPhone when we\\'re out and about at night. \\n\\nBut my question is that if I go with the Z50 and use the 16-50 mm lens, will it really be compact; that is, will it fit in a jacket pocket for a winter jacket?  I\\'d love to go to a store and see for myself, but there are no stores around me that sell cameras, and while there are two Best Buys relatively nearby, neither carry the Z50.\\n\\nSo any feedback on this one would be appreciated.  \\n\\nThanks. . •\\t\\u2060Budget:400-600 used\\n•\\t\\u2060Country:USA/ Caribbean islands\\n•\\t\\u2060Condition: used but fully functional\\n•\\t\\u2060Type of Camera: dslr/mirrorless\\n•\\t\\u2060Intended use: photo- kids, birds, landscape \\n•\\t\\u2060What features do you absolutely need: quick manual controls- \\n•\\t\\u2060Portability: 7 out of 10\\n•\\t\\u2060Cameras you\\'re considering: Nikon df\\n•\\t\\u2060Cameras you already have: none - just iPhone XR : learned on a D50 20 years ago- I loved that camera and the controls became intuitive\\n•\\t\\u2060Notes: I am really loving the idea of the Nikon df- but perhaps I should just look for an updated equivalent Nikon that would be similar to a d50?\\n\\n. Hello,\\n\\nI have just acquired a Sony A7 III. I do both photography and videography, and I am starting to take on small contracts for social media.\\n\\nI am looking for a monitor that is both useful and affordable. I came across this product on Amazon, which seems interesting to me because it is easy to transport, inexpensive, and allows me to export videos directly to my phone.\\n\\nMy question is: do you think it is compatible with my iPhone 16 and my Sony A7 III? Or do you have a better option to suggest?\\n\\nThank you very much!\\nProduct link: \\n\\nhttps://a.co/d/4gltuNK. i’m wanting to make my instagram be super high quality and clear, photography wise. This sub has made me realize an Iphone is the only thing needed and you don’t have to splurge $3000 on a great setup. \\n\\nI’m just starting to edit and learn that editing makes big differences in photos. I have an iphone 16 Pro Max. Should I change the settings at all? I’ve been told that ProRAW is for people who know how to edit and it takes up a lot of space. I also know that HEIF is good, but is that really a setting people always shoot with? Or do people just keep basic settings and shoot? Does zooming lose quality? Thank you all!\\n\\n\\nI just got lightroom, but I think i’ll cancel because i’m starting to realize most people use the free mobile lightroom. Do most people just buy a preset and rock with it? how do you find the ideal one? I don’t want to waste €10 each time and come to find out I don’t like it. I’m still experimenting with LR to learn more. Any tips will help!\\n\\nWith that being said, what settings, lightroom editing, lightroom presets, or any other tips should I know being a newbie to this whole process?!. **Budget**: $400-$600\\n\\n**Country**: US\\n\\n**Condition**: Used\\n\\n**Type of Camera**: DLSR/Mirrorless, I am unsure.\\n\\n**Intended use**: Photography mainly, minimal video\\n\\n**If photography; what style**: landscape/street travel photography in general\\n\\n**If video what style**: N/A\\n\\n**What features do you absolutely need**: Nothing in particular\\n\\n**What features would be nice to have**: weather sealing maybe for travel, flip screen\\n\\n**Portability**: Small bag I do not mind if it is a bit bullky\\n\\n**Cameras you\\'re considering**: Nikon D3500, Nikon D7200 and Sony a6400\\n\\nI have found in my area the following second hand:  \\nNikon D7200, Nikon AF-S DX Nikkor 35mm f/1.8 G Autofocus Lens for APS-C Sensor and Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G Lens (also includes a tripod and batteries/charger) - $525\\n\\nSony Alpha a6400 & (2) kit lenses E PZ 16-50mm / F3.5-5.6 OSS (also includes additional battery charger, along with extended dual battery camera add-on) - $550\\n\\n**Cameras you already have**: Iphone 14 camera.\\n\\n**Notes**: I am doing a god bit of travel this year and I would like to capture it, I am a total newbie when it comes to photography apart from the basics. I am unsure between a DLSR and Mirrorless since I have not used any and DLSR is getting out of fashion. I would probably upgrade any of those systems with a zoom lenses but in a few months after I learn. I also enjoy a \"old\" (probably wrong term) to some photos in a vintage way.\\n\\nThank you!. This may be a strange question and I am not knowledgeable about cameras (which is why I came here.) \\n\\nI work for an office where we need to film recipe videos and take photos for social media. However, our recipe videos do not need to be fancy, they are simple tutorials for our staff and only internal. The only things that need to look \"nicer\" are our food photos. I have an older Sony A6000 and IPhone 16 Pro that I use to take photos of our food, which has worked out well enough.  (We really started from the bottom here so any nicer photo than what we had is a huge improvement.) We have access to a professional photographer for big shoots, but not these every day video and photos.\\n\\nI have some experience and comfort with cameras, but still learning on my own. But I will have to pass on this work to various staff members who have zero camera experience and can pick up some things, but don\\'t know much about settings or how to navigate that (and honestly...are not super willing to learn the details.) They just want something they can point, set up, shoot, and it comes out decent enough to have a clear video for staff training. \\n\\nThe boss asked to purchase an office use digital camera. But I have no clue what would be a good option that\\'s user friendly and would give a good video and photo. I thought about the Sony ZV 1, because it seems pretty straightforward and could have auto settings that any team member could use. I also thought about the ZV-1F as it came up as \"user friendly\" but a review said it\\'s best for video only. \\n\\nWe also thought the most user friendly would be an IPhone 15 or 16 Pro 😐 however, our department doesn\\'t believe we can purchase a functioning phone without a carrier, which IT does not allow. \\n\\nDoes anyone have a recommendation for a user friendly camera that\\'s good for video and photos? Preferably under $1000 as we are a small office with a small budget. TIA!. Are they really worth the going rate on eBay? I feel like $200-$225 is just too much for what\\'s basically just another enthusiast-level compact.\\n\\nOnly reason I want one is I like the design and features, but unlike the XZ-1 and XZ-10 it doesn\\'t suffer from the same severe purple fringing as those two.. Hello there ! \\n\\nWell to make this as short as possible, I have this hobby xD i love shooting photos and videos i invested in a iPhone and iv been editing and recording for a while now, i wanted to step it up a bit and go PRO\\n\\nWell i found and found these 3 camera\\'s for the stuff i do i like a hybrid cam that i can use how  i want either to shoot photos and record content, light weight for travels \\n\\n  \\nMy picks : \\n\\n>Sony ZV-E10 + 16-50mm\\n\\n>Fujifilm X-S10 + 18-55mm\\n\\n>Canon EOS R50 RF-S18-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM & RF-S55-210mm.

I was hoping for some help and recommendations. I am not especially knowledgeable about cameras unfortunately. But I have a very good friend who is, and even worked software-side for a studio at one point. However, he does not have a proper camera of his own. He LOVES going hiking and photographing wildlife, mostly birds, but has been using a combination of his phone camera and a pair of binoculars to take pictures of them for years.\\n\\nHe has always said he wants to someday get a DSLR camera like he used to use at the studio, and this year I wanted to surprise him with one at Christmas. I think I want to get him a mirrorless to future proof for him, and because they are more travel friendly. I want to get him the camera body with an “all purpose” lens and a distance lens for under $1000. I know the really great wildlife cameras are 2-3x as much, but i figure it’s still enough for an upgrade.\\n\\nI think I have narrowed down my choices to either the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV with 14-42 mm and 40-150 mm lenses, or the Sony a6400 with 16-50 mm and 55-210 mm lenses. I would appreciate anyone’s thoughts on if one would be better than the other. Or if there’s another option in that price range i should consider. Just to note, i know for starting out that used cameras are a good option, and i would probably follow it for me, but since it is a gift for someone else i really just want to get them something new or at least refurbished by someone reputable.\\n\\nThanks for any help!\\n. Okay so, 17M, I have a **ZV-e10** and a **Iphone 16 pro**, I wanna learn how to use them properly. Ive seen many people achieve great colors outta the Zv-e10 with Cineprint and Film Vision and I have no idea how to do that, what settings do I need to change to be able to use plugins like that and all that. So if someone is kind enough to teach me about this stuff it\\'ll be super crazy for me. Also would love to learn about Apple Pro Res! . Hello everyone, I\\'ve never gotten into proper photography but I\\'m thinking it may be time to change that and take my pictures to the next level. I\\'ve only ever used my iPhone 8 Plus & 13 Pro to take pictures, but what I really find enjoyable is editing, being able to convey what was going through my mind when I took the picture or what I remember it looking like from my perspective as most phones fail to capture the scenery faithfully. In that sense, I\\'ve enjoyed my iPhone 13 Pro a lot since I\\'m able to take RAW pictures and do wonders with apps like VSCO & Lightroom, making some colours pop, others fade, playing with light & shadow, exposition... \\n\\nI prefer landscape photography more than anything, so I would love to be able to capture details in mountains from a closer look maybe through an actual proper zoom? As the iPhone starts to lose a lot of quality after the 3x zoom. I\\'m one to go hiking through different sceneries so I also need something that\\'s easy to pack and carry inside a trekking bag. \\n\\nThank you for reading and hopefully you\\'ll be able to guide me into finding the camera of my dreams! Nevertheless, I hope you all have a good day.. As said, I impulsively paid $200 for a 16 year old Nikon D5000. Got home and realized it’s only 12.3 megapixels and can only record video at 720p 24fps. My iPhone 8 is 12 megapixels and can record at 4K 60fps.\\n\\nI guess my question is, was it as bad a purchase as it sounds or are the redeeming qualities to the Nikon that make it better than my phone?  Did I just toss out $200?. The gist: All of my pics from my SD card got erased overnight. I\\'m on vacation for another week and don\\'t have my laptop. Is there any way I can cover my pics from my SD with my iPhone?\\nThe backstory: I\\'m on a trip and I used a Kodak Pixpro f55 to take pics. My SD card to iPhone converter wasn\\'t working so I bought a new one for $25 (RIP) and it still didn\\'t work to import. I tried connecting to a Samsung as well and it still didn\\'t work. I recently updated to iOS17 and I read that SD card readers are incompatible with the new iOS versions. Anyways, I could still browse the photos from the SD on my camera so I figured I would just wait until I get home from my trip next week to upload on my laptop. EXCEPT this morning I tried again to browse the pics on both my camera and to connect the SD reader to my phone to find ALL OF THE PICTURES GONE. Like the whole card is wiped. Thankfully all the other pics I have backed up, EXCEPT THE ONES I JUST TOOK ON MY TRIP. I won\\'t be home for another 6 days-- is there anyway I can recover the recent pictures from my SD through my iPhone, or even my friend\\'s Samsung phone? PLSSSSS I\\'m crying. Hi All,\\n\\nI need advise. I take photos while traveling (architecture, nature, animals). I travel a lot (10 times per year). But I\\'m still rather \"advanced amateur\" than professional  \\nI\\'m moving from iPhone and old Nikon D5100 to something new and I\\'m considering these three options:  \\n1. \\xa0Sony A7 III + 28-70 mm f/3.5-5.6 (ILCE-7M3K)  \\n2. Canon EOS R7 + RF-S 18-150 IS STM  \\n3. Nikon Z50II + 16-50mm VR + 50-250mm VR\\n\\nWhat would be your choice?\\n\\n  \\nThanks!. Hello, I made quite the jump from iPhone 6 to the iPhone 16 pro max\\n\\nIt was a support gift for my youtube coding channel. I did faceless videos and now want to film myself too\\n\\nI want some professional guide to master the camera part of my iPhone. And also some filming tips & tricks\\n\\nAny recommendations? thanks!\\n\\n. This is a larger scope question than what is the usual best specific camera or lens. I want to discuss about the strength and weakness of the major manufacturers, let\\'s say canon, fuji, nikon, om system, sony, panasonic (in alphabetical order).\\n\\nWhich system is better overall, better for still phography. Comparing camera body and lens lineup. And for specific style, street photography, studio portrait, macro, landscape, etc. I have done a lot of research but I want your opinion, I may have skiped or overlooked important details.\\n\\nI shot, with canon bodies and lens for 25 years, starting with a film FTB, then an a70, a 10d, a 20d, a 30d,  then a 5d. After some health issue, I wanted something lighter and I switched to fuji. Since 8 years, my main camera is a xt2. I never enjoyed shooting with the xt2 as much that I loved shooting with the 5d. The focus is unreliable and the Fuji ergonomics are not my type. Recently, Fuji aimed their r&d toward film simulation and their recent AF firmware updates are a disaster. I don\\'t need (or like) a crammed 40mpix on a crop sensor, shooting raw, it produce large file. There is no real pro camera body from Fuji. A month ago, the shutter of my xt2 refused to open, I sent the camera for repairs, I still haven\\'t received any news yet. It broke my last bit of loyalty toward Fuji.\\n\\nI am now considering switching system again. I have things that I liked about canon I never had with fuji (like reliable AF...), and now that my main camera body is dead, it is possibly a good time to switch, but the economical loss would be substantial.\\n\\nI went to a camera shop and played with a canon r6ii, a sony a7iv, a nikon z6iii and a fuji xhs2. All about the same price, with a 24-105mm F4 lens or equivalent. The Fuji was my least favorite (slow overall), followed by the Sony (due for an update soon). The Nikon and the canon were my favorites. But I played for less than 10 minutes with each bodies and it is hard to make an opinion. \\n\\nThere is also the fact that switching brands implies switching lens ecosystems. I am having an hard time comparing the systems. If I go for the Fuji, I will keep all my lens (10-24mm 18-55mm, 16-80mm, 55-200mm, 80mm macro, 23mm, 35mm) and my flashes (godox V1 and godox transmitter). But something inside tells me to run away from a company that targets jpg film simulation users. Not that it bad, it is just not for me. \\n\\nAny ideas are welcome. \\n\\nEdit: grammar.. In 2012 I bought a Canon PowerShot SX260 HS for a 17-month backpacking trip. It performed wonderfully, helping me capture great shots throughout. I mostly used manual settings. \\n\\nNow, twelve years later, I’m preparing for my next big trip, which is 40 days in Japan and Vietnam. After a decade heads down at a tech company, I’ve been out of the photography game. \\n\\nI’ve done some research, but would also love feedback. Would I be better off using that same Canon (it still works), using my iPhone 15, or buying a PaS camera. Seems like prices have gone up quite a bit. I don’t think I could spend more than $400USD. Maybe I could get something decent used? I see a Sony DSC-RX100 III for $425 on Face Marketplace\\n\\nThank you in advance for your advice on how I should capture memories going forward. \\n\\nUpdate: I purchased an RX100 M3 for $400USD. \\n•\\t\\u2060Budget: 1,000\\n•\\t\\u2060Country: USA\\n•\\t\\u2060Condition:\\n•\\t\\u2060Type of Camera:\\n•\\t\\u2060Intended use: Photos and videos I wanted to make YouTube videos and I want to take good pictures\\n•\\t\\u2060If photography; what style: street photography and car photography \\n•\\t\\u2060If video what style: I want it to be able to record cars in high speeds and no rolling shutter\\n•\\t\\u2060What features do you absolutely need:\\n•\\t\\u2060Portability: I want it to be portable\\n•\\t\\u2060Cameras you\\'re considering: 100vi\\n•\\t\\u2060Cameras you already have: just my iPhone 16 pro max, I had a zev10 but I disliked the rolling shutter\\n•\\t\\u2060Notes:. hello! \\n\\nfound my old camera from when i was a kid and wanted to use it again because i love taking photos. however the dial is faulty?? \\n\\n\\nwhile im taking photos, it somehow auto adjusts the dial on screen and puts it to video mode or some other mode and makes it difficult to take photos or videos because it gets interrupted. \\n\\nany way i could fix this? im scared of removing the dial and trying to fix it somehow through that bc it might just break forever :(\\n\\neverything else seems to be in good condition, just the issue abt the dial :/ \\n\\nthanks!\\n\\ntldr: my camera’s command dial is possessed . Hey guys, so I’ve been looking to get a camera to shoot pictures as a hobby. I don’t really care for video so I only really care how the camera performs for photography. My main use case would be capturing pictures of clothes for lookbooks. As well as some general photos(semi candid) of me and my friends/family, or places I like. I don’t plan on taking professional photos for people, it would all be for my own sort of personal visual diary just documenting things that are cool or mean something to me. For a bit of a reference since I’m bad at explaining things, I’m really inspired by things like the old “asayan” magazines, so I’d probably taking those types of pictures, and I really like the supreme book by phaidon. \\n\\nWith context out of the way, my situation is, I have a friend who has a canon eos trebel t6 with a Ef 50mm f/1.8 stm lens that will give me his stuff for free. And I have another friend with a sony a6000 with stock lens offering to sell me the cam + lens for 300. My question is, will the canon be quality enough? Or should I just invest some money into getting the a6000 and maybe upgrading the lense. I know value is subjective but I guess I just want to know how big the difference is in quality between the two. \\n\\nThanks yall     . Hello everyone! I\\'m a beginner photographer looking to invest in a new camera, and I\\'d appreciate your insights. Here’s a brief introduction and my completed questionnaire below.\\n\\nI\\'ve been using a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ101 for travel photography, a camera I received from my parents several years ago. For a long time, it produced much better photos than my iPhone, which is why I always took it along on trips to capture memories. However, after recently upgrading to the iPhone 16 Pro, I’ve noticed that the quality difference between the Lumix and my phone has become less noticeable. In fact, the photos from my iPhone now seem almost on par with the Lumix, and I find myself using my phone more often because it\\'s more portable and convenient.\\n\\nThis is what’s prompting me to look for a new setup. I’m hoping a mirrorless camera will once again provide a clear improvement in image quality compared to my phone. The challenge is that I don’t have enough experience to accurately compare mirrorless options to my Lumix, and I’m worried about spending a significant amount on a setup that offers only a slight improvement over the Lumix (or the iPhone).\\n\\nAny recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\\n\\n* **Budget**: 1\\'000 Swiss Franks (roughly 1\\'100 USD)\\n* **Country**: Switzerland (or Germany)\\n* **Condition**: New only\\n* **Type of Camera**: Mirrorless\\n* **Intended use**: Mostly photography (95%). I would mostly use it for travel photography, which is why portability and weight are important factors to me.\\n* **If photography; what style**: Travel (people, portraits, outdoor, streets, cities, architecture, food, indoor)\\n* **If video what style**: vlogging\\n* **What features do you absolutely need**: since I am a beginner, I think I would need a camera that shoots great JPEGs (I do not intend to process my photos, for the beginning at least). Easy of use are important as well as portability.\\n* **What features would be nice to have**:\\xa0easy way to transfer photos to iPad or iPhone\\n* **Portability**: shoulder strap\\n* **Cameras you\\'re considering**: I am considering a sony a6100 with the sony e 35mm f/1.8 OSS (SEL35F18). I just recently watched a youtube videos where it was recommended as a good camera setup to start exploring photography. \\n* **Cameras you already have**:\\n   * Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ101:I like about it that it\\'s very portable and easy to use. I dislike the Panasonic Lumix app for transferring photos (it takes ages). For some reason, the camera cannot be detected by iPhone or iPad when plugged in via micro-USB.\\n   *  iPhone 16 Pro (don\\'t laugh, I will explain under \\'Notes\\').\\n* **Notes**: My \"workflow\" is that I shoot photos during the day (JPEG, mostly in intelligent/automatic mode) and in the evening, I will transfer all to my iPad Pro in order to see them on a large screen and be able to choose the ones that I would like to keep. I will then edit (crop, adjust colour, etc.) them ever so slighty in the Apple Photos App (so no professional photo editing). Lastly, I will upload them in my familiy\\'s shared iCloud photo album.. UPDATE: THINKING Canon EOS R10 Mirrorless Camera with RF-S 18-150mm Lens Kit\\n\\nIt\\'s more than twice what I thought I\\'d buy but seems like, if I don\\'t like it, I can sell it with not much loss.

I took some photos of the moon over the water on my iPhone and decided there and then that I needed a camera that could better capture what I see. I want more details, like the shadows of the moon, the reflection of the leaves.. If I go for a long exposure, I get a dusk or dawn look, not a midnight one. Ugh.

Didnt dislike anything, just didnt use them any more.\\n* **Notes**:\\xa0\\n\\n1. Hey, thanks for reading and any help.\\xa0 Quick background is I was a novice photographer before - D40x, D3200, had the 18-200VR, a 50mm prime, decent speed lights etc.\\xa0 Had kids and just couldn’t be bothered with using the cameras, indoor or out, whilst dealing with two kids under the age of 3.\\xa0 They are older now so I have a little more freedom.\\xa0 I’m leaning towards the SL3 but I wanted to know if I’m missing anything that could be a better fit.\\xa0 I dont need a DSLR but I do want a really shallow DOF and I’ve yet to see a compact produce this.\\n2. My primary camera will be an iPhone Pro model, which I will take the majority of photos and all video.\\xa0 The reason I want the dedicated camera is for family events/portraits.\\xa0 Taking shots of anything else will be a bonus but I’d only use the camera if it was in my hand - I’d pretty much always reach for the iPhone first.\\xa0 I might take it to sports day but unlikely as the environment rarely allows it nowadays. I won’t be taking it to school performances as photos aren’t allowed. I’ve no real interest in shooting anything but family - Ive still got 120GB of travel photos to sort out from the ‘before kids’ time!\\n3. I loved having the 18-200 because it meant I could stand away from my subject(s) and get some great candid shots.\\xa0 I dont want to get too close as it ruins the ‘moment’.\\xa0 It would be great to have this again.\\xa0\\n4. I will shoot mainly indoors in varying light.\\xa0 I know I’ll need to use/get a flash but I’d prefer to rarely use this.\\xa0 Using the flash ruins the moment (as above) and, more importantly, a key family member is hyper light sensitive so flash bursts cause them pain.\\n5. I do like using a viewfinder; the visual isolation it gives me is preferred over a screen.  However I like the ability to see the realtime results to settings changes.  Having said that, an excellent auto mode is my preference.  I\\'ve got used to the smartphone doing everything and am not looking to go back.\\n6. I really like the out-of-the-box colour profile of the Canon’s.\\xa0 I prefer a slightly warmer photo.\\xa0 On that note I dont want to do much, if any, post processing.\\xa0 Shoot and done, therefore RAW isn’t necessary. \\xa0\\n7. I won’t use the camera for taking video, or at least thats not a primary purpose - it’s more of a spare.\\xa0 It would be nice to be able to use it as a streaming camera on occasion.\\xa0 I’m at the age where the older folks are passing on and I’ve had the job of streaming the family events. Currently using 4/5 iPhones so another camera is a bonus.\\n8. I won’t be taking it out much BUT I might take it to family events overseas.\\xa0 Therefore I’d like it to be small to fit in my bag, in addition to all the other family traveling crap.\\n9. I\\'m open to any brand. The only reason I\\'ve mentioned Canon so much that brand came up in terms of body size, and price.\\n\\nNot too sure what else to add other than budget is super important.\\xa0 I’d like to keep below £350 but would go up to £450 if it was a bundle deal with batteries, lenses, etc.\\n\\nAny additional info required to help you help me, please ask.\\n\\n  \\n\\\\*Edit: updated needs/wants based on comment from u/SlicedAorta. Before I get into this, I will preface with a message for anyone who doesn\\'t read the full thing ... if you sell a camera on eBay, **DO NOT SHIP IT USPS.**\\n\\nI recently sold a NIB camera on eBay and shipped it USPS Priority, opting for insurance for the full value of the camera (because this was the most expensive thing I\\'d ever sold on eBay).  \\n  \\nI bought a label and packed it up the same day I sold it, then dropped it off at the post office the next morning. Then the fun began.  \\n  \\nIt bounced around my city for five days before finally making it to KC (3 hours away). Sometimes there are delays ... I get it. That was Aug. 16-21. \\n\\nOnce it got to KC, it got stuck in some weird loop bouncing back and forth between my city\\'s PO and the KC PO as I got a bunch of general \"Processed through USPS facility\" without any details. After about a week of this, my buyer (who has been super cool and understanding) asked me to look into things. \\n\\nI then got passed from one unhelpful CSR to the next over the next few days, until I got sent to an actual agent dedicated to tracking down packages. He found the package in KC, assured me it was intact and told me that it was flagged in their system so that the next time it was scanned, it would be sent from KC to Florida (end destination).\\n\\nThat was 7 days ago. It just, TODAY, updated in the system that it departed the KC distribution center at 6 a.m. Prior to today, I\\'d just seen a lot of \"in transit\" messages with automated 12:00 a.m. time codes.\\n\\nAs I said, my buyer has been super understanding, but we\\'re coming up on almost a month since he bought the camera, and he has an event this weekend he needs it for. He wants to express order the same camera from B&H and return my camera to me when it arrives, which leads me to my question:\\n\\n* **How do I process a refund/return to an eBay buyer if the package is on the way to them?** \\n\\nThis whole thing has been the biggest headache - I\\'ve never dealt with anything like this selling on eBay over the last 23 years. \\n\\n. For context, I learned to shoot on a Pentax DSLR in high school. Not sure of the model but it is at least 13 years old.\\n\\nI\\'m going on my honeymoon in Europe in October and I\\'ve decided I want something better than an iphone 12 to capture there. I also really would love to get back into photography as a hobby. I learned using film and I really enjoyed learning the ins and outs of the mechanics of a camera.\\n\\nI have heard great things about the mirrorless fujifilms that are out now. But I am open to other brands as well.\\n\\nI am trying to keep the budget around $1200 (lens included). Also, I am looking for a camera sold at BestBuy so my husband can get no intrest financing (please no judgements)\\n\\nHere are my potential options as someone relatively new to this hobby again. I love landscape photography, and definitely some portrait thrown in here and there.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n \\n\\n**Sony - Alpha a6400** with 18-135mm lens\\n\\n**Nikon Z50** (this kit comes with both 16-50 mm lens AND 50- 250 mm)\\n\\n**Fujifilm - X-T30 II** with 18- 55 mm (i LOVE the idea of film simulation on this. right now it is sold out on BB so I\\'m not sure when it will come back in)\\n\\n **Sony - Alpha a7 II** (most affordable option) with 28- 70 mm lens\\n\\nAny suggestions are very appreciated <3\\n\\n&#x200B;. I recently got a new Iphone 15 Pro 3 months ago with an iOS 17.9 installed in it and normally I would be able to transfer the photos that I took from my Fujifilm X100F using the Fujifilm Camera Remote app smoothly, same as for the previous phones that I used to own (e.g. Iphone 13)\\n\\nBut one time, I installed the iOS 18 on my phone. Ever since then, I can\\'t seem to connect the WiFi on my phone to my camera to transfer the photos. It would always say \"Unable to connect\" on my phone and the camera itself would crash and hang.\\n\\nI tried everything that I could to fix this problem but there is no solution to it. Whether that be updating my software again, updating the camera remote app or resetting the phone or camera\\n\\nAre the issues one of the following?\\n\\n1.) Camera is already too old?\\n\\n2.) The new iOS 18 is very strict with WiFi restrictions?\\n\\n3.) The phone itself is the issue?\\n\\n4.) Need a new firmware on the camera?\\n\\nWould be glad to let me know some suggestions, solutions and insights regarding this issue!\\n\\nThank you and would love to have more feedbacks on it!. https://reddit.com/link/1gclosl/video/fhxuhhhqw3xd1/player\\n\\n  \\n  \\nNeed help isolating a problem, the camera still works fine (Can still preview and take multiple photos/videos) but it seems to glitch out and freeze intermittently. I then need to do a reboot by taking out the batteries just to get it working again. Tried a new SD Card(8 and 16 GB) problem still happens, gonna try and find a 2GB SD card and new batteries to see if that fixes it. Also want to try reseating the ribbon cable if that fixes it too.\\n\\nWanted to do a firmware update but It seems like the C series is nowhere to be found on the Fujifilm firmware website and in wikipedia too? (Unless there\\'s another name for this in other regions??)\\n\\nMaybe someone can help if I can use another camera\\'s firmware update with \\\\~somewhat the same time as this camera was released (probably a bad idea to do this now that I\\'m thinking about it....)\\n\\n(Camera probably is just old :/ hoping this isn\\'t a problem that involves the camera\\'s hardware itself, bad capacitors etc. but i\\'m coping its not)\\n\\n[https://fujifilm-x.com/global/support/download/firmware/cameras/#finepix](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/support/download/firmware/cameras/#finepix)  \\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujifilm\\\\_FinePix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujifilm_FinePix). My little brother is looking for his first camera. He has an iPhone 13 and he wants an upgrade. He will mostly be using it for landscapes as he hits up some national parks on a cross country road trip. He would also like to use it for every day stuff like pictures of friends and gatherings, stuff you\\'d post on social kind of things.\\n\\nOne thing he made a point of is he doesnt really want to learn to edit at this point so out of camera jpeg quality is important. I think he might learn to edit raws at some point though.\\n\\nHe doesnt have any particular budget, but he is a grad student so not exactly flush with cash. I\\'m looking for something that is good and get him on a system that will last but without breaking the bank.\\n\\nAs a Canon R6 owner myself, I feel like FF is not the right move for him. Size and price wise it just doesnt make sense for him. If I\\'m wrong on this let me know. So I\\'ve been looking at MFT and APSC cameras. Also I haven\\'t explicitly talked to him about buying new vs used, but I think he\\'s more comfortable with buying new.\\n\\nWith that said, I\\'ve narrowed it down to the Olympus OM-D E-M10 IV with the 14-42mm kit lens and a Lumix G 20mm f1.7 pancake OR the Sony a6400 with the 16-50mm kit lens and a Sony E 20mm f2.8 pancake. Both are around the $1000 price range with the MFT system coming in a few hundred dollars cheaper. While none of those lenses are stellar, the roughly 24-70mm equivalent range on the kit lenses are versatile and the roughly 35mm equivalent pancake lenses are good every day carry size and focal length.\\n\\nThe Olympus has IBIS and the Sony has better AF. The Sony also has a larger sensor, but I think for what my brother wants, I dont feel like sensor size is the end all be all. Other than that, both of these look decently portable and powerful. Other cameras that were considered were the Canon R50, Nikon Z50, and Fujifilm X-T30. But I think between pricing, size, and lens selection, my brother liked the a6400 more than those other cameras. I personally dont want to count out the Olympus yet though since MFT is a solid system to get into without breaking the bank and if/when he starts to collect more lenses, the price and size of MFT starts to really shine. But that\\'s IF he gets more into it and buys more lenses.\\n\\nWhich one of these would you choose? Are there any glaring issues with either of these kits? Is there something else better that I overlooked?. So I have a iPhone 12 mini. I’m very tiny so having a small phones is amazing but I’ve been taking content creating (grwm/fashion) seriously. Is it worth it to upgrade to the 16 max coming out ? Or is there an older version that the cameras are similar? Or should I keep my 12 mini and get a dslr ? Dslr suggestions? . Ik it’s probably just a ton of saturation and editing but still. Hi everyone, I’m looking for a camera for my holidays since I only have an iPhone 14. For the last two years I started to search for a camera, ending with upgrading my iPhone and sticking with it.\\n\\nI’m NOT a photographer, i don’t know any theory (I just try to use the rule of thirds without success) and I only know the basics of how a camera works (exposure, time..), I just want something that gives me more quality and, most of all, the chance to zoom a landscape or a detail. \\nI’m interested in a used mirrorless camera since it’s more compact and portable than a DSLR.\\n\\nMy budget is around 400/500€ and I found some Sony Alpha 6000 with the 16/50 lens (or some Fuji XT1, XT100)\\n\\nDo you think it will we a good choice? Otherwise a good P&S? I’m not a lot into editing my pictures..\\n\\nThank you!! \\n. Hey everyone,\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve been into photography for many years now, and I currently shoot with a Sony A7iii. However, I’m looking for something more portable as a daily driver. I’m torn between getting an iPhone 16 Pro or a point-and-shoot camera, specifically considering the Ricoh GR IIIx or the Sony RX100 VII.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe main factors I’m considering are:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t1.\\tPortability: I want something easy to carry around for spontaneous shots.\\n\\n\\t2.\\tImage Quality: While I know the iPhone 16 Pro has a great camera, I’m curious if a dedicated point-and-shoot might still offer better quality.\\n\\n\\t3.\\tLongevity: I’m aware that smartphones typically don’t last as long as cameras, and I’m concerned about the long-term investment.\\n\\n\\t4.\\tCost: The iPhone is quite expensive, especially considering its shorter lifespan compared to a camera.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven these points, what do you think is the better investment for someone who already has a higher-end camera but wants something more convenient for daily use?\\n\\n\\n\\nThanks in advance for your advice!. From a guy who never used a camera before but was keen on photography and loved taking photos on his iPhone I can proudly say this is the perfect camera (atleast for me).\\n\\nFor 4 years I’ve been planning to buy a camera, a dslr to be specific. I’ve had multiple choices with a budget of 500 dollars such as t7, r100 and the famous d3500.\\n\\nI’ve also looked at the used market and in the country that I live in not a lot of good choices.\\n\\nAnd then I stumbled upon the fz300 earlier this year and it has everything except sensor size. That was the number one thing people criticised about the camera when I was researching.\\n\\nBut the 25-600mm zoom lens just looked too good since I won’t have to change lenses, it can also be a bad thing since I can’t physically change the lens because it’s a bridge camera.\\n\\nAnd then I looked at this American website called Adorama which sells used and new cameras and it had the fz300 open box condition (little to no use) for 350 dollars.\\n\\nIn the end of April I went for it\\n\\nNow for the review:\\n\\nI recommend learning manual it took me 1 week to learn light metering and the exposure triangle so it doesn’t take long.\\n\\nSettings: the aperture goes from 2.8 to f8 which is not bad but it could be better if it could go up to f16. After using it for a while I saw that the camera camera is at its sharpest at f2.8-5.6 but f8 is still good.\\n\\nISO is pretty good aswell but the noise starts kicking in at 800-1000 so I’d say that’s the limit I set it on. \\nTip if you get the camera: go settings and set the ISO increments to 1/3 to get numbers like 130-160 instead of 100-200-300.\\n\\nShutter speed: works great nothing to say other than that.\\n\\nZoom lens: Okkkkk here’s the fun, this lens is insane with a 24x zoom there’s barely a drop in quality when you are fully zoomed in it’s genuinely mind blowing.\\n\\nI wanted something like this for wildlife photography and taking photos of the moon.\\n\\nI’m telling you zooming in at 600mm with a high shutter speed and using the tripod the quality is exceptional and what’s even crazier most 200-600mm lenses for Dslr cameras cost in the range of 500-3000+ dollars. Ik they are better since you can see the difference when you crop the image but it’s not a 800 dollar difference atleast not for me since I’m not doing it for professional photography.\\n\\nGenuinely excellent lens especially for the price I can say you cannot get better (don’t quote me on this, I only have this camera).\\n\\nThe difference in quality between the camera and my iPhone 13 Pro couldn’t be bigger. When you get a camera and crop into the photos the quality doesn’t change that’s the difference between iPhone and cameras. I even compared the quality to my friend’s iPhone 15 pro and the camera is miles ahead.\\n\\nThe video quality is amazing aswell when I first entered video mode I was shocked by how good it looked 4k video quality never looked better. Nothing bad to say about video mode except that idk how to change the format from 16:9 to anything else(I wasn’t bothered to look how.\\n\\n. The touch screen is great and responsive.\\n. A lot of YouTube tutorials I recommend Graham Houghton or Shutterbug if you want a quick summary.\\n. View finder is also amazing (if it looks blurry there’s a small scroll wheel that changes the focus of the view finder)\\n. Digital zoom is much better than manual zoom for me so that’s a plus (I have used manual zoom on my friends cameras).\\n. Battery life is good lasts me about 600-1000 photos and it charges in 2-4 hours to full.\\n\\nFinal thoughts and summary: for the price of 500 dollars or if you can get a good quality used one that’s even better there is no better camera, also no need to spend money on lenses since this lens goes from 25-600mm and that’s about it I give this camera 9.5 or 10/10 the quality can get better but for this price I don’t think it can.\\n\\n(100% recommend)\\nOfc I will include proof of how good it is with photos here’s my instagram photo account enjoy.\\n\\nPs: INSTAGRAM lowers the quality for some reason so the photos are even better.\\n\\nThe example photos: https://www.instagram.com/omxr.photography?igsh=YXRya21pN3A5YzB6&utm_source=qr. TLDR: Need a good camera for Europe travel but confused over three options. Main uses: travel photography, portrait photos, home videos, and landscapes (when home.)\\n\\n\\n\\nHi Guys,\\n\\nI\\'m just starting out with photography  again since my childhood point and shoot died a few years ago. Ordered the Canon gx7iii because I am going on a trip to Europe for two months and wanted a good compact camera since I don\\'t want to use my iPhone on the trip. (MyiPhone is an 11 and the battery drains very quickly when taking photos/videos. It\\'s got about 2hrs max and I don\\'t want to carry heavy power banks with me.)\\n\\nMy Criteria for a camera is :\\n\\n1: Be small enough that it would be easy to keep in a handbag or small carry bag, but also light enough that it won\\'t be too heavy as I have a max of 25kg for flights inside the EU.\\n\\n2. Take good videos and photos for the trip without having to mess around with settings too much. I want to do both photos and vlogs to keep my family updated - but I\\'m not an influencer or such to be posting them on the internet. (Both are just keepsakes for memories for my friend and I.) As for the settings, I don\\'t mind having to fiddle with them a bit before I go, as I do have two months to play with the camera but having something that I can take more of in the moment photos or one that I can save presets would be great.\\n\\n3. Be preferably in my price range or close to it (800-1,200 AUD)\\n\\n4. Ideally be able to transfer photos via bluetooth - I do have an SD card slot in my laptop, but while I\\'m overseas I\\'d love to update my family on where I am with a snap or two.\\n\\nNow when I ordered the Canon, the salesman basically told me that it was one of the best for point and shoots, but that he could recommend I get the Nikon Z50, which is more expensive but apparently is a better camera and would be better in the long run. He said like the Canon, the Nikon is also great for taking both photos and videos, but also gave some more specs that he said were better.\\n\\nI\\'ll be honest, in that apart from Aperture, which I have already experimented with on my friend\\'s old Nikon, I am not the best at understanding what the differnces mean on the spot. So this was a tad confusing - if someone can break it down for me what the differences actually mean I would appreciate it.\\n\\nI do love the feel of the Nikon camera as it\\'s more what I am used to and feels more natural - having a viewfinder is a big plus to me as well and I like how the screen flips so if I want to take videos smiling at the camera, it\\'s easy to see where I am. I am just not sure if it\\'s worth it since it is an extra $600 over the Canon, is bigger in size and it is over what I originally budgeted. Also don\\'t know if I really would purchase extra lenses in this year and from what I have read, the additional lenses you can buy for this model are quite limited. I\\'ve also read that the stabilisation isn\\'t as good on the Nikon, but unsure how this would affect most things.\\n\\nBut on the other hand, I usually take all my family\\'s photos on my iPhone, so would love something that I could improve on and that would be able to take better pictures. I do have some experience with DSLR cameras, as I\\'ve helped video a few friends for university projects, so it\\'s not too unknown to me, I\\'ve just never had one of my own.\\n\\nDoes anyone know if there is much difference between the two and what would be better both in the long run or for the trip? Have watched countless reviews on YouTube on both cameras but was unable to find one that compared them directly. I did find reviews for the PowerShot SX70HS which looks possibly like a decent camera as well but I only came across this yesterday, so haven\\'t done much research.\\n\\nI\\'m so sorry if this is a long question - I am just very conflicted as to which choice I should go through with. If anyone has any suggestions, even for a different camera, I would be appreciative..  Let\\'s get straight to the point. I like to shoot landscapes, especially mountains, I want to shoot some street photography here and there if I\\'m visiting a downtown area. I like to hike and take pictures it makes me feel alive lol. For now, I\\'m using my iPhone 13 for pictures and using Lightroom mobile to edit my pictures.\\n\\nI had experience using a camera back then and was able to use PS as well so I know the gist of it but it\\'s been so long now I want to go back to using an actual camera for hiking trips. \\n\\n  \\nThis camera are what I found that are in my local store.\\n\\nFujifilm X A5 Bundle  \\nCanon EOS Rebel T7 Premium Kit\\n\\nCanon G7X Mark III\\n\\nSony A6300 w/ 16-50mm LE\\n\\nCanon EOS R50 w/ 18-45mm\\n\\nCanon EOS R100 w/ 18-45mm\\n\\nSony A7 ILCE-7k w/ lens\\n\\nSony A7 II w/ lens.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey are within my price range but with Sony A7 II it\\'s pushing it a bit.. Hello, I want to make youtube videos and looking for the cheapest option that is better than an iPhone camera. The iPhone camera is very good, so this may get pricey, but also, I know nothing about cameras.\\n\\nUpdate: I just bought a Canon EOS M5, is this going to be better than iPhone XR for video?. Hey there!\\n\\nI currently own a Sony NEX-3N with a 3.5-5.6 16-50 kit lens. I\\'m happy with this camera, but I want to get something better. My budget for camera and lens is around 700 USD. I will be using the camera primarily for street photography, as well as nature and animals (not wild). I might film some videos too, although I have an iPhone which is great for that. I\\'m also looking for a lens included in this budget and I like my 16-50 lens but i\\'d like to have a little more zoom and lower aperture for more background blur when taking pictures of animals. I would also like to buy the camera and the lens new, or a checked used one in a great condition.\\n\\nThanks!. My budget is around £300 and I’m open to second hand options. Ideally I would like a small zoom lens (around 16-50 mm) or pancake lens (24mm) with it too, and sensor size should be APS-C.\\n\\n### Contenders\\n\\n- Sony A5000\\n- Sony A5100\\n- Sony A6000 (most inclined towards)\\n- ~~Canon EOS M~~\\n- ~~Canon EOS M3~~\\n- ~~Nikon J series~~\\n\\n**Which would you go for and why?**\\n\\n***\\n\\n### Comparison of specs\\n\\n> Other camera models are being considered.

Hi\\n\\nI\\'m completely new to cinematography but I\\'ve been tasked at work to start filming training videos, and to find a SLR camera that works.The idea is to film someone performing a task at a fairly close range, then edit it in Davinci Resolve to show everything needed..\\n\\nAn older colleague said the lens we should be looking at would be 18-80mm, since we don\\'t need much zoom, but he\\'s been out of the cinematography game for a number of years so he doesn\\'t know what a good camera is nowadays\\n\\nThe only real requirements are 4k and 50 or 60 fps so that it can be edited, zoomed and whatever without losing too much quality (end product going to be 1080p at most likely \\\\~30 fps)preferably with image stabilization\\n\\nI can\\'t film at 30 fps though since there are a lot of fluorescent lights running at 50hz and from the short videos I\\'ve taken on the work iPhone and 30 fps = loads of flicker. 60 fps and its much less noticeable. ideal would be 4k50 fps, but from looking at cameras all morning 50 fps doesn\\'t seem to be all that common? but perhaps any camera that can film at 60 can film at 50?\\n\\nI\\'ve noticed some cameras say 4k60p (Cropped) but I can\\'t really understand what that cropping means? is it because the sensor is 4:3 and the video ends up in 16:9 ratio? so it crops it a little? Do I need to care about that?The cameras I found that can film 4k 60 without cropping are over 40000 SEK (Way over budget)\\n\\nThe budget is south of 20 000 SEK, which is about 1800 USD, this is the budget for camera, lens and at least a monopod. where the camera and lens make up the majority of that cost I figure. We might be able to stretch it, but 20k is the approved budget.\\n\\nThe cameras I\\'ve looked at so far are:\\n\\nPanasonic G100 - found this one for 10000 SEK (941USD)It seems like an ok choice, but I can\\'t tell if it has a built in lens or not?\\n\\nCanon EOS R10 - I found this camera for 14000 SEK (1300 USD) for just the camera.This seems like a decent midrange camera for the job, it\\'s a bit pricey, but I think we can swing it.\\n\\nCanon EOS R7 - Found this one without a lens for 17000 SEK (1600 USD), but that doesn\\'t include a lens, and I haven\\'t found it locally.\\n\\nThere are a few more I\\'ve found, the biggest issue is finding it locally since my boss is wanting to buy it tomorrow and have it ready next week.. A very tall order I know... I am a 16 male who got hooked by photography by a point and shoot camera, which I watched lots of videos and learned almost everything I could before getting an actual camera. I like mostly to get pics from car and nature but portraits too but not as much as the other two. I looked around the internet and found canon r50, what is y\\'alls advice and suggestions?\\n\\n\\nCurrent Camera: Canon PowerShot a3400 is\\n\\nBudget: CAD$1000 or USD$732\\n\\nCamera Found: Canon r50\\n\\n\\nUpdate: I got the Canon Rebel t7 because an emergency came up that I had to spend a lot of money which I found t7. Its been a week since I had it and I think that it is absolutely awesome. I believe my mental state is at its best right now and I am very productive. even though it was not a long time since I had it, I have gain a huge obsession over it and like it very nuch. The only biggest problem I have with t7 is the low fps for taking pictures, its 3fps and is highly noticeable. Thanks for the people that helped me.. Also if you happen to know the model as well, let me know. I’ve seen him use Sony A7iv, so I’m sure that’s the same body I have but I can’t tell what lens this is.\\n\\nIf this isn’t the right place I’m sorry.. I\\'ve been filming on my iPhone for awhile and was planning on taking the next step to a full-fledged camera setup. Here\\'s what I\\'m planning on purchasing. I\\'d love some feedback. I\\'m looking primarily to make vlog-style/cinematic videos but I think also having a camera that can be applied for other stuff like headshots/multipurpose would be useful.\\n\\n**Sony a6700 (\\\\~$1300 with student discount)**\\n\\n* This seems to be a great option for vlogging and is the high-end APSC option. I don\\'t want to break into fullframe because of the cost of lens. I was debating between the a6700 and the ZVE-10 but I\\'m leaning towards the a6700 because I heard the zve-10 ii is going to come out soon and the a6700 is more recent. It is more expensive though so I\\'d love to hear thoughts on this or if there are other camera suggestions. Based on the lens I get, I\\'d also like thoughts on if I should get the kit lens 16-50mm or if I should just get the body.\\n\\n**Lens**\\n\\nSony E 11mm F1.8 (\\\\~$400)\\n\\nAND/OR \\n\\nsigma 16mm f1.4 lens  (\\\\~$400)\\n\\n* Both seem to be great/wide enough for vlogging style shots \\n* Any thoughts on lenses for cinematic style video and for bokeh effect? \\n\\n**Rode VideoMicro 1 ($28)**\\n\\n* Simple, cheap but solid. I know the second one came out but from reviews I heard the first one is just as good. Thoughts on 1 vs. 2 or alternatives?\\n\\n**Tripod**\\n\\nManfrotto MTPIXIEVO-BK PIXI EVO 2 Section Mini Tripod ($67)\\n\\n* Simple and solid\\n\\nI have a sub $2000 budget but I\\'m flexible. I just want to get the most bang for my buck and also future proof the camera. For everything besides the a6700 and the mic, I\\'m willing to buy used. Open to suggestions as to how and where to search for these! I\\'d love suggestions on anything that I\\'m missing!. I’m looking to step up from my iPhone to a mirrorless.  \\nI found a Sony a6000 with the kit 16-50, sigma 56mm f1.4, and a Sony 20mm F2.8 and two batteries. Is it worth the $800 they are asking. It’s about 1.5 hrs from me. \\n\\nSuper new to shooting on anything other than an iPhone. I’m taking some classes in the next couple weeks.  \\n\\nI like to shoot cars/motorcycles and landscape, while I’m out riding around  \\n\\nThanks for the help. . I have been using my friend\\'s canon kiss x7 for over half a year now. I have been pretty decent with taking landscape and travel photos with it. The most I use is a zoom lens 200 mm.  I also use my iPhone 14 pro to make cinematic travel videos.\\n\\nI am in need of a camera which can do both, taking decent photos and excellent handheld videos, preferably UHD 60/120 fps. It should be budget friendly too :)\\n\\nMy best option right now -  \\nSony alpha a6400Y S with 16-50 OSS + 55-210 OSS at $880 (Amazon Japan)\\n\\nCan you please let me know if I have any better options in this range. Also the disadvantages of having a 6400.  \\n  \\nEdit: I just realized that both the frames I am getting with the camera are APSC cropped frame. Can you please tell me how it will affect the videography. \\n\\nThanks in advance. My needs:\\nSmall and can fit in my purse, film like, better quality than iPhone or at least make me feel like it is even if it isn’t. I have an iPhone 14 I don’t plan to upgrade yet. \\n\\nI’d use this for Instagram and personal use, maybe photograph some flowers and do baking vlogs on YT. It’ll me a daily camera that I keep in my purse to capture travel and activities like zoo’s, hiking, vacations, food etc \\n\\nI currently have a canon M50 mark ii 15-45mm and 22mm fixed lens which I put back in its box after 2 test shoots and have tried to sell but no biters so it’s just gathering dust. I didn’t like it, I don’t like having to carry lenses and it didn’t fit in my purse properly, I’m frustrated at needing to always prepare for or change settings to fit what I’m shooting. I need a point and shoot camera. I’m not a professional nor a photographer so I’d be happy with something easy. I had a huge list of contenders and narrowed it down.\\n\\nToo 3 contenders: \\nCanon g7x mark iii\\nFujifilm x70\\nSony Zv-1\\n\\nOther things I considered but ultimately not going with:\\nCanon m10\\nFujifilm x70\\nDon’t sx\\nSony RX100\\n\\nSony a5100\\nSony a500\\nSony a6300\\nFuji film x pro 3/4\\n\\n\\nI know Fuji is coming out with an updated version of a new point and shoot as well. I would love any advice!! I have seen too many YouTube videos to make this choice any easier.  . I have an iPhone 13 pro max. I just got my a6400 with a 35mm f1.8 prime lens. So far indoors the iphone gives similar quality pics indoors. And in a dark room at night (lights off), the Iphone gave better pics. The a6400 was blurry (prob needs a tripod). I have it in auto mode. Am I doing something wrong, or is the iPhone actually as good as the a6400 and the camera was a waste of money?\\n\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nYes, I absolutely realize I need to learn the camera. I used to own a Nikon D3000 (used mostly in manual) and used Aperture (miss that software, wish apple didn’t get rid of it) to postprocess. But at the time I owned that camera, phones took pretty terrible pictures even when compared to auto mode on my camera. This post was more about how now the iphone takes better looking pictures unless I start adding things like tripods and post processing. This was not true a decade ago.\\nI have to relearn a lot of what I used to know. Haven’t touched a camera the past 8 years and never truly learned to edit images (just played around in Aperture and learned things that made my pictures look better).. TLDR:I am a senior in HS. I’ve owned a Nikon z50 for 3 years and just purchased a z6 II. The z6 III is expected to come out soon. I don\\'t know if I should return the z6 II and wait/upgrade to the z6 III when it comes out; or; stick with z6 II. I am worried I regret not being patient by waiting an extra month for the upgrade. But I did get the z6 II at a $400 discount. My instinct is telling me to wait for the better auto focus and higher MP sensor and higher fps than the z6 II. I am leaning towards returning the z6 II. Trying to figure out if it’s worth the incremental cost and hold out for the z6 III.\\n\\nIn 2019, when I was in middle school I invested in a Nikon z50 with the 16-50 and 50-250 kit lenses. The camera has seen its fair share of use and some rough handling, resulting in malfunctioning dials and occasional lens registration issues. In anticipation of a family trip over the 2023 Christmas break this year, I decided to upgrade to a Nikon z6 II with a 24-200 lens. I figured this would be both an upgrade and a more reliable camera. My only hesitation was that I have been hearing rumors that a z6 III may be coming out soon. While rumors weren’t leading me to believe I should hold out for the Z6III, the idea was still in my head that holding off on the z6 II so I could buy the z6 III might make sense. In the end, I purchased the z6 II with the knowledge I would return if it didn\\'t prove to be a game-changer. After my purchase, more credible sources hinted at the potential release of the Nikon z6 III within the next few months, putting me in more of a dilemma about whether to stick with the z6 II as the return window deadline of January 31 approaches. While photography used to be a daily ritual for me, recent times have seen a decline in my photo-taking activities. Unsure if this is due to time constraints or a fading interest, I\\'m also contemplating my college major, veering away from photography but still considering related fields. Perhaps I’m just taking a break from photography, perhaps my interests have changed, or perhaps I just wasn’t as engaged in photography because my camera was unreliable. Regardless, I still enjoy photographing nighttime scenes and sports. Comparing the z6 II to my z50, the difference is remarkable. However, the autofocus falls short in my mind, and I find myself wanting a faster rate than 14fps and a higher resolution than 24.5 MP. I also want cool futures that would come with a new and hopefully updated firmware for the camera. I was Initially attracted to the z6 II\\'s discounted price of $1600, I had to purchase the 24-200 lens for an additional $800, bringing the total cost to around $3000 after accessories like insurance, extra batteries, and memory cards. Looking at the Nikon z6 II, it is a significant improvement from the z50, but I don\\'t want to regret my purchase for the next few years, just because I didn’t want to wait a few months and spend a little more money.. Here\\'s the dilemma: the z6 II, released in 2020, may soon be overshadowed by the newer z6 III. Anticipating a cost of around $2500, the total investment would reach approximately $4000. As I prepare for college, even with my summer jobs, this is a significant cost for me. While the prospect of investing a quarter of my savings is daunting, I’m more concerned about living with the regret of this camera. Balancing financial responsibility with the desire for the latest technology, especially right before college, leaves me uncertain and looking for advice.. \\nHey there! I’m a 16 year old wildlife enthusiast and I’ve been into wildlife photography for a while. I’ve just been using my Iphone 11 to take shots and videos and I’m looking to upgrade to an actual camera. I’m looking for something that can really stand the test of time and the terrains I’ll be traversing with it, which are usually mountainous and wet. At the same time, I’m not looking for those wildlife cam setups that can take a picture of an eagle 50km away, just something that can take decent wildlife stills AND video since I’m also planning on using it to create YouTube videos.\\n\\nI’ll be honest, I’m not too familiar with camera terminology and I’d really appreciate it if the cameras you reccomended came with explanations as to why you reccomended them.\\n\\nMy budget is around 1,300 USD for both the body and lens(es). Objects located in home. Like clothings, tools.\\n\\n\\nWould be really good if camera could nicely comprehend sunlight and not suffer from it.. TLDR:\\n\\nHave Sony A600 w/ Kit Lens, GoPro11, and Deity D4 duo. Should I buy a ZVE10 or DJI Pocket 3?\\n\\n**Background:**\\n\\nI have a Sony A6000 with the kit lens (16-50). It works well for photos, and I\\'ve used it for video with a capture card for live stream, recordings, etc. The bummer with the A6000 is, that there is no audio input (besides Sony\\'s mics). I also have a GoPro Hero 11 that I use for vlogging with a Deity D4 duo and DJI Wireless Mics. I also have an iPhone 15 pro that I have used before as well.\\n\\n**The ask:**\\n\\nI have been eyeing the new DJI Osmo Pocket 3 quite a bit. But.. I am wondering if I would be better off just buying a Sony ZVE10 body to use for vlogs and other content creation. I like the idea of the pocket being small, but if the ZVE10 would be more future-proof, that could be nice I think.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAny feedback or opinions are welcome! Thanks for reading. Hi everyone. I’m a beginner creator and I‘m currently searching for equipment for sns content creation. Mainly YouTube vlogs/ indoor videos and reels and maybe streaming later. I’m currently having an I phone 13 plus pro (might update to the 16 plus pro later this year) and a go pro hero 10. So I was actually only looking for a decent mic and thought of getting the DJI wireless mic 2 system. \\n\\nDuring my search however I also come across the Osmo Pocket 3 which also includes the mic 2 if you buy the creator combo. The Osmo pocket 3 with the mic would be 300 dollars more expensive than the mic system alone. Obviously the mic system comes with 2 mics a charging case and a receiver which allows you to use it on several devices. \\n\\nThe mic that comes with the Osmo Pocket comes without any of that however can be connected via Bluetooth to several other devices.\\n\\nMy question would be if it is worth to get the Osmo pocket 3 with my current set up (especially if considering upgrading to the I phone 16). And is a Bluetooth mic reliable enough to use it also later with an I phone or any other devices.\\n\\nOr would it make more sense to save the money, get the dji mic 2 set with 2 mics, charging box and receiver and use it on my current phone. Hi! I just bought a Canon Powershot SD 500 Digital ELPH 700. The camera is from 2005. I have been searching the internet on how to connect my camera to my iPhone or laptop to download pictures. I looked at the Canon website and since the camera is no longer produced they do not have updated instructions on how to download it. The model does not show up as an option on Canon Camera Connect or Image.cannon\\n\\nI have an iPhone 14Pro and a MacBook Air that was bought in 20 so it is a slimmer model that does not accommodate older plugs.\\n\\nAttached are pictures of the cords that the camera came with in the box and the camera itself. I do not have anything that works with them since I have more current technology. The camera came in its original packaging and is in pristine condition.\\n\\nI appreciate any and all help or advice! Thank you so much! I want to use the camera for pictures and memories with friends :)). I intend to go to Japan with my friend next year and would like to capture and record many memorable moments. I want to capture stunning night photography. I\\'m mesmerised by the beautiful nightlife that brightens the city. I will also attempt to take some cool shots of myself and my friend in iconic locations. I have an iPhone 14 Pro Max and a GoPro Hero 12, but I do not want to pull out either of them often, and the idea of a mirrorless portable camera strapped around me is enticing. Also, the GoPro 12 is more of an activity camera with a short, hour-long battery life.\\n\\nA camera that, through some video research, has caught my attention is the Nikon Z 30 + 16-50mm DX VR Kit. (I assume the extra lens will give me the luxury of zooming in and out—something I would like.). The photo quality is just as good as some 24/26 MP cameras and is capable of taking some stunning shots. Another plus is that the video recording is exceptional too, at a very nice price point of under £800. I do not want to exceed this budget, as I\\'m not a professional and will be using it at home or on city trips after this Japan journey.\\n\\nDoes this camera meet my demands? Is there a better one? As you can tell, I am quite inexperienced, but I do love taking photos. Any advice would be greatly appreciated :). Hello, I am a beginner looking to get into photography as a hobby only. I will be capturing mountains, lakes, lush green sceneries, random family pictures mostly. I also have a sports car which I will begin tracking/Auto crossing and want to photograph it, although this is least of task I will accomplish with the camera I ll buy, but i will just expect descent car/motorsport pictures. Video is only 10% of my priority.\\n\\nMy current budget is 1500 cad including a versatile all in one lens and I might upgrade glass not any soon but may be after a couple of years. I cannot extend my budget to a full frame , So based on these requirements and initial research I am thinking to get this used a6600 that comes with kit lens I believe? Or if I need to get another lens on top if this , please suggest something under 500 CAD.\\n\\nFor folks in canada, this is from Gosselin and their product rating is 8 for this listing.

Hey folks, would love to know and discuss camera kit for outdoors/adventure filmmaking and photography. I’ve settled on a 16-35 f4 for the lens, as I can’t justify the weight and bulk of the f2.8 version. Also, I was really surprised about the performance of the iPhone 15 pro max. What’s in your kit?. I\\'m narrowing in on my first camera purchase in about 14 years.\\n\\nI used to own a Nikon D90 DSLR with the a kit lens, but kind of fell out of the photography thing once I got an iPhone in 2011 or so.  The D90 just collected dust until I sold it off about 2 years ago.When I did use my D90 it was overkill for where I was as a photographer - I basically shot everything in  auto mode.Now I wish to get back into photography as a hobby.  \\n\\nMy kids are off to university and I\\'ll be going on trips more frequently now.I\\'ve signed myself up for an online class, and have been researching travel-friendly camera systems that I\\'d likely buy into used gear for now and be able to sell off if possible to purchase a different system or newer gear if this hobby sticks and grows (I have a problem with switching hobbies sometimes).Budget is not an issue, but again I don\\'t want to lose my shirt if I get distracted with something else as a hobby in 6 months.I\\'ve narrowed my choices down to either a T5 or an A7C.  \\n\\nI need the whole system to be light enough to travel with and carry around on excursions.My questions concern 2 areas:\\n\\n1. As a precursor to the area #2, I\\'d like some advice on how to best determine what kind of lens(es) (prime vs zoom) and also in what ranges I should get for travel.\\n   1. I analyzed the focal lengths of most of the quality shots I took during my use of my Nikon D90 (which had a kit lens 27-150) - and 80% were in the 27-60 range with 20% in the 60-150 range - however I remember often having a need to go wider with that kit lens I was using.\\n   2. So, I was thinking a zoom 18-135mm with a 16mm 1.4 prime for the Fuji T5; or, if it\\'s the A7C then just a Tamron 28-75 + Sony 16-35 f2.8 (so 2 zooms).\\n2. Purchase prime lens (or 2) vs. a one zoom lens for travel (and what kind of a collection/combo of lens would be best for travel)\\n   1. I\\'ve never used just primes, but I like how they are smaller for travel - do they really constrain in in regards to taking the shots you want (i.e. do you need to physically move a lot more to get the shot you want vs. a zoom where you would just shoot from where you are standing?)\\n   2. For example, for the T5 I was thinking their 16mm f/1.4 + 18-135mm\\n3. Fuji vs. Sony (T5 vs. A7C)\\n   1. I appreciate the tactile physical dials on the T5, but also like the more compact A7C and it\\'s better AF.\\n   2. But more than anything I\\'m having a hard time assessing the lenses in each brand in regards to what I would need for travel while keeping each kit travel-friendly.  Any recommendations on a comparative travel set for each brand would help.. is there a small phone sized camera that takes iphone 15 quality photos? preferably with multi lenses and sensors like an iphone. Basically an iphone 15 camera without the phone part.\\n\\nI found the light L16 camera which would’ve been perfect except for the fact that its software and firmware stopped getting updated a while ago. plus it seems like something a more professional photographer would use, i want to take random everyday photos along with more better quality shots taken by an amateur like me.. Hi! Looking for some insight. My current camera lineup is:\\n\\n* bodies: Canon 60d, Canon 6d mark ii\\n* lenses: 50mm f/1.4, 16-35mm f/2.8, 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6, pancake 24mm f/2.8\\n* other: iPhone 13 Pro, Minolta 70w film camera (though with increased film costs, looking to not be as into that going forward)\\n\\nI primarily do street photography, some photoshoots and headshots, some event photography, and just general hobby shooting. I\\'ve been photographing for years and have had my Canon 60d for about 10 years now, maybe 11. It\\'s held up so well and I\\'m so attached to it, but I recently picked up the 6d which I\\'ve grown more attached to.\\n\\nI\\'ve been wanting want to get a premium point-and-shoot (maybe fujifilm x100v or vi?) as a walk-around to use a bit more than my phone, mostly as personal preference. Should I trade in one of my canons + 50mm/24mm for some credit? I\\'m also super attached to my 50mm, but not attached to my pancake and zoom lens.\\n\\nAny other recs are great too!. Im buying my first camera and i\\'ve been choosing for days...\\nI\\'m going to buy one among these three for street photography🙏🏻 For X-E2 im gonna match it with xc 15-45mm/ xf 16-50mm. I want one with better zoom cause i find most of my work i took in my iphone 14 pro looks good when zoomed... (if you know what i mean) please help and im thankful for any sort of answer!. Hi all, is the a6000 still a good choice for exploring photography as a hobby? I am interested in landscape and wildlife photography mostly. I was going to pick up a used a6000, and used 16-50mm, 55-210mm kit lenses and a used sigma 16mm 1.4 lens to start off with. Will these take higher quality photos than my iPhone 13 Pro? Appreciate any thoughts or tips.. Hey all!   \\n\\n\\nI\\'m looking to upgrade from a Nikon Z50. I love this little camera. With the 16-50 DX it\\'s the perfect EDC for me. It has made me pick up photography again after the iPhone relegated years of carrying around a D70s + lenses, a sad common story from what I\\'ve heard.   \\n\\n\\nHowever, as much as I love the Z50, I want to do a close-up project where it lacks one important thing: focus bracketing. The Zfc has it, and the Z30 has it, but what seems like a minor firmware upgrade Nikon could do for the Z50 as well, has become a trigger for me to upgrade to something that also addresses some of the shortcomings of the Z50 (battery life, better EVF, better AF, etc). \\n\\n\\\\[ Please note, if the Z50 would have a focus bracketing I could use handheld, I could perfectly live with all the shortcomings, but here comes our friend GAS. \\\\]\\n\\nIn Nikon, I narrowed the options to the Z7 + 40mm F2 because of good price used (below 2k€), good IQ, good megapixels for cropping and big prints, etc. But the AF is so-so, and I\\'m pissed of at Nikon for being behind in the game in terms of AF and specs in their cameras (and slow release of them!), and also treating APS-C like an upgrade tier. The Z8 seems great but is out of range, and the Zf seems intriguing (finally good AF from the Z9/Z8, lots of dials) but tad bulkier than I\\'d like. There are some 3rd party lenses with good IQ and good price.\\n\\nAfter years of DSLR, I value very much compactness in my setup. But I also want a great IQ, and particularly for this close-up project, good resolution to be able to do bigger prints with lots of detail (the idea is to end up as huge prints, like 50x40\", 60x50\", etc.) and cropping. \\n\\nThat\\'s what pointed me, in spite of leaving behind the APS-C compactness factor, towards the idea of FF for quality + sharp compact prime, for \"compactness\" (although, I probably could also make work APS-C + AI upscale for this.)\\n\\nBut, that said, it seems a part of me got caught good in the early waves of digital photography marketing selling FF like the ultimate upgrade (where it was prohibited expensive, +10k), and I have an itch to try FF to know if it\\'s really for me or I should stick with APS-C :shrug:\\n\\nMy budget is \"the less the better\", but I\\'m willing to look at 2k€ bodies (used or new) with \\\\~500€ used lenses.\\n\\nI\\'ve spent days researching, more than I\\'d like to admit. I started with Nikon, because I love their bodies and is what I\\'m used to. I do have only Nikon lenses, but the APS-C ones from my DSLR times are useless (thinking of trading in MPB) and for the Z system I only have the 16-50mm; so it\\'s not a decisive factor.\\n\\nThen I moved to Canon. I\\'ve never been a huge fan of their bodies, but they\\'ve got great mirrorless specs and feats (I learned that Canon is the only one to offer focus stacking in the camera). R7 looked good and was also a good option for more sports shoots, but it still APS-C (which I could make work). R6mk2 looked good also for FF with a 50mm, but bulkier than what I\\'m aiming for. Closed lens ecosystem (don\\'t like), although good 2nd hand market.good 2nd hand market.good 2nd hand market.and market.g (finally good AF from the Z9/Z8, lots of dials) but tad bulkier than I\\'d like.

Yesterday night was the A7CR, before that, the Z7, and before that, the R6mk2... I\\'ve tried to get a hold of these cameras in-store, but they don\\'t have them around.

Learned that starting with the A7V all their latest models offer focus bracketing (not in-camera), best AF out there, good specs, and discovered their compact line: A7Cii and A7CR, both with focus bracketing (not the A7Cmk1). \\n\\nThe AC7R seems to offer everything I\\'m looking for: best AF, compactness, huge resolution (perhaps too much? but it allows to 1) crop a lot so a prime can go a long way and 2) use APS-C lenses crop with 24mpx, which would be slightly more than the 20mps of my Z50). Prices are high because there are very new (2.6k€ for the A7CR new) but there are lots of used lenses at good price and 3rd party ones with good IQ and good price.\\n\\nSo, here we are... every day, I research and go to bed thinking I\\'ve found the one.

I still have one big store to check out for this because feeling would be a huge deciding factor.  \\n\\n\\n(For the record, I also looked into Fuji but paying those prices for APS-C seemed too much for me)\\n\\nOk, reddit... after this wall of text... what do you got for me? Are there any other options I should look? Should I stick to APS-C and forget FF? Should I suck it up and do focus bracketing the manual way (tried, no luck) or with an app (also tried, no success) or even grab a cheap Zfc for this project and forget about all the GAS? . Hey there! I’m a 16 year old wildlife enthusiast and I’ve been into wildlife photography for a while. I’ve just been using my Iphone 11 to take shots and videos and I’m looking to upgrade to an actual camera. I’m looking for something that can really stand the test of time and the terrains I’ll be traversing with it, which are usually mountainous and wet. At the same time, I’m not looking for those wildlife cam setups that can take a picture of an eagle 50km away, just something that can take decent wildlife stills AND video since I’m also planning on using it to create YouTube videos.\\n\\nI’ll be honest, I’m not too familiar with camera terminology and I’d really appreciate it if the cameras you reccomended came with explanations as to why you reccomended them.. I\\'ve been thinking and researching options for photo/video setup for when I travel and have narrowed it down to three different options, each with pros and cons: OM System OM-5, Fujifilm X-S20, or a second high-end smartphone. \\n\\nI\\'m looking for advice on which would be the best investment for my use case. I currently use my phone, but I don\\'t want to have my phone out and exposed all the time while traveling since I rely on it for other important things. \\n\\nMy budget is roughly $1500. \\n\\n**What is important to me:**\\n\\n* Lightweight (incl. lens/lenses), effective IBIS in photo + video, durable enough for travel with normal protections, and good SOOC jpegs\\n   * I plan to shoot raw+jpeg, but if I\\'m being honest out of 100 photos I might edit 2 of them, so I mostly want things to look nice enough SOOC.\\n   * I also don\\'t plan to be carrying a full-size tripod when traveling, so handheld shooting performance is important. \\n* Something that I can enjoy for a long time. I can see myself getting more lenses, but hopefully the body is one I\\'ll keep around for many years.\\n\\n**What I take pictures / videos of:**\\n\\n* Landscapes, cityscapes, architecture, streets (but more environment vs focusing on a particular person). Occasionally myself or my wife when traveling. I will be shooting mostly around f/5.6 or f/8 and mostly on the wide end of standard focal lengths (i.e. 24mm to maybe 50 mm FF equivalent)\\n* I shoot 70% photo and 30% video. So not a ton of video, but enough that I can\\'t ignore video performance.\\n* Back when I had a DSLR and some point and shoots many years ago, I mostly used Aperture Priority. I will probably mostly use Aperture Priority on the new camera, only use Manual if I\\'m in low light and need to really tune things.\\n\\n**What I don\\'t need:**\\n\\n* I don\\'t need strong tracking AF or super burst speeds since I don\\'t take photos / videos of fast moving subjects really.\\n* I don\\'t need super high framerate video either (although resolution is nice for cropping options), 30 fps with good detail works for me.\\n* I don\\'t really vlog and don\\'t plan to, so vlog feature sets (i.e. mic/headphone jack, product focus modes, etc...) aren\\'t super important to me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**The options:**\\n\\n* **Option 1: OM-System OM-5 w/ 12-45 f/4 PRO ($1399):**\\n   * Pros:\\n      * Reliable weather sealing on both lens and body\\n      * Very effective IBIS\\n      * M43 lenses are small and lightweight (although not necessarily cheaper than other systems)\\n      * Lots of computational features for getting the most out of the m43 sensor\\n      * High quality glass as the kit lens\\n   * Cons:\\n      * I\\'ve heard that the video autofocus is somewhat inconsistent and that it hunts a lot\\n      * High detail 4K video bitrate only available in 24 fps (not 30 fps)\\n      * A few of my friends/acquaintances who are into photography seem to lack confidence in OM System as a company being around for very long and they mentioned that getting into an OM System camera might not be a good investment. They recommended to go Panasonic if I want m43.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Option 2:** **Fujifilm X-S20 w/XC 15-45 ($1399):**\\n   * Pros:\\n      * Great SOOC jpegs with lots of options from the film simulations\\n      * High resolution 6.2K open-gate video allows for more cropping / framing options\\n      * The latest processor seems to have improved AF reliability quite a lot compared to older models\\n      * XC 15-45mm lens is really small and light, but still optically good for non-professionals\\n   * Cons:\\n      * Not weather sealed (body or lens).\\n      * Video IBIS seems to have questionable effectiveness (i.e.: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SNpW2i-aU0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SNpW2i-aU0))\\n      * Other lenses are bigger and heavier than m43 counterparts\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Option 3:** **A second smartphone (i.e. Pixel 8 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max)**\\n   * Pros:\\n      * Small, very convenient form factor, less conspicuous (everyone has a phone)\\n      * Weather sealed and pretty durable\\n      * Cheaper than mid-range mirrorless cameras + lenses\\n      * Strong stabilization for photos and videos, paired with fast glass\\n      * Computational photography makes consistent results, often \"good enough\" for capturing memories of a trip\\n   * Cons:\\n      * Inconsistent image quality between the different fixed lenses due to varying sensor size\\n      * Small sensor sizes, have to lean on the computational photography\\n      * Stuck with the focal lengths that came with the phone\\n      * Less control over what SOOC images will look like\\n      * Performance degrades over time (battery, keeping up with updated software, planned obsolescence), not sure if it will last many years\\n      * I already have a Pixel 7 Pro\\n\\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/18liimk). Ok, let\\'s do this in parts:\\n\\n1. A little background, I\\'ve been taking photos and making videos for a while now as a hobby (mainly  landscaping/portraits and those \"\"\"\"\"cinematic\"\"\"\"\" style videos) and occasionally making some money out of it, but I\\'m by all means a beginner and don\\'t really intend of evolving it into a career path.\\n\\n2. I\\'ve been thinking about upgrading my gear (kinda falling apart lately), so I\\'ve come up with either the Sony a6600 with a wide angle ( probably sigma\\'s 16 1.4) or the a6700 with kit lens for now (I can only come back to my country with 1 lens without being taxed)\\n\\n3. My budget is about 1200~1500 dollar (hopefully more on the lower side, since my country\\'s currency exchange sucks really bad...about 6x the price bad)\\n\\n4. I\\'ve been seen a lot of video comparisons between iphone\\'s 15 pro max and some mirrorless cameras and...well...I really got confused which one was which a couple of times, specially with the whole prores log footage thing (bear in mind guys, I\\'m just a beginner trying to do my best here).\\n\\n5. Since the iphone kinda fit budget wise (and maybe then some) and wouldn\\'t need extra lenses, would you guys thing that that would be a better deal than start investing in camera gear from scratch?\\n\\n(I do realize the irony in asking if a phone would be better than a camera on a camera focused subreddit, so think of it not as which camera is better, but as what would you do in my shoes here). today I went out to a Lamborghini event, took a bunch of picture with my Sony A6000. Problem is, I have a Sandisk Adapter for microSD, microSDHC and microSDXC. I use a 64gb sdxc. Now I got home to transfer all the photos to my iphone 13, i use an adapter SD card reader for iPhone but i kept plugging it in and out and the import option was not popping up, i updated my phone to the newest iOS update and nothing changed. I popped the SD card back into my camera to look at the pictures and then it told me that my SD card was not formatted. and being completely clueless as to what that meant, i tapped format and now all of my photos are gone. Memories with friends and family, car pictures, pictures of scenery, and more all gone. \\n\\nif anyone has any idea on how to help with photo recovery on an SD card please let me know. i’d do anything to get these photos back they mean the world to me. in advance thank you :). Hello to the fine photophilic folks of Reddit. I\\'m a marketing assistant looking for a new camera to update from a Kodak Easyshare Z981 that long predates me here at my company. I\\'ve been learning what all of the tech specs mean, and I *think* I have a grasp on what I would need, but I would appreciate any advice or corrections you all would be willing to provide. \\n\\nAny suggestions would be most helpful if they are at/under $1000 (the lower the better) and include any necessary lenses. \\n\\nWhile I have a [camera in mind (Link)](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Mirrorless-Processor-RF-S18-45mm-Microphone/dp/B0C5LNKYLP/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=RIARWO621ZY3&keywords=eos%2Br50%2Bcontent%2Bcreator%2Bkit&qid=1694447131&s=electronics&sprefix=eos%2Br50%2Bconte%2Celectronics%2C101&sr=1-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1) I am not sure if it matches all of my criteria, or if it is overkill. I picked it because it is relatively cheap, *seems* sufficient, and includes a nicer microphone than we own, which will be good when I remind my boss that we need more/better video content. The wireless remote seems handy for tricky interior shots.  \\nHere\\'s what it *has* to be able to do:\\n\\n* Take interior architectural photography in dim-light settings with no staged lighting. (Assuming a modern mirrorless/DSLR\\'s range of ISOs, is f4.5 sufficient?)\\n   * The locations are function-focused municipal worksites I.E. water and wastewater treatment facilities. They\\'re often cramped, low-ceilinged, and full of stuff.\\n* Take exterior architectural photography in variable weather/lighting conditions.\\n* Take aerial photographs of facilities and municipalities.\\n* Shoot video at 1080p 30fps.\\n\\nHere are things I would *like* for it to be able to do:\\n\\n* Shoot video at 1080p 60 fps to be slowed down for slow-motion video at 30 fps.\\n* Geotag.\\n* Wirelessly connect to an iPhone 8s.\\n* Have a few hours of battery life, in case I leave it on accidentally between setups.  \\n\\n\\nI thank anyone willing to reply to this beast of a post in advance. . Hi all!\\n\\nSo I have been doing a lot of filming on my iPhone 13 Pro Max for awhile, and because I do it often (and use Final Cut Pro on my Mac for editing) I have really been getting the itch to get an actual camera.\\n\\nI would like to start with an APSC camera as their lenses are cheaper than full frame, and I was originally thinking of the Sony Fx30, but then the Sony A6700 (a hybrid) came out, and it is the same camera but with update autofocus, tech/touch screen in terms of video. However, the Fx30 also has dual card slots and a internal fan, but most of the shooting I do is more studio and when outdoors, short. The A6700 evidently had a quick update when it came out that, unless you are blasting 4K 60 frames or above, doesn’t overheat that easily (so I am reading). And it seems to be able to integrate live streaming easier than the Fx30 and doesn’t seem like it will blow up/overheat in a controlled environment easily.\\n\\nAnyways, so I was wondering as someone wanting to dive into actual camera’s, is the A6700 (sold out everywhere it seems) a good start for video or should I look at something else? Starting at 1400, I could pick up a lens to go with it (thinking the Sigma 18-50) since the Fx30 starts at 1800.\\n\\nAnyone actually have the A6700 and could let me know how it is? Or any suggestions for the leap into an actual camera? I am pricing between 1500-2200 atm.\\n\\nThank you for your responses!. I have a Panasonic TZ80 which I use for holiday/travel snaps and make good use of the excellent zoom.  Since I travel I like to geotag my photos but the TZ80 doesn\\'t have GPS.  Currently I just take a junk photo with my iPhone at the location and then after transferring the TZ80 photos to Apple Photos use an app to update the GPS information from the junk photo.  So a pain to do every time. \\n\\nSince I want to keep the zoom characteristics, my choice of replacement camera is limited. \\n\\nI looked at the HX90V, which has GPS but from what I read it\\'s poor.  Needing a few minutes to get a GPS fix every time you move and also GPS drains battery life. \\n\\nNow I\\'m looking at the HX95/99 which don\\'t have GPS but apparently have Bluetooth and the means to get the location from the iPhone via the Sony app. \\n\\nSo finally to my question:-)\\n\\nAnyone out there with a HX95/99 using this.  What\\'s the real world experience.  Does it just work or is there any faffing with Bluetooth or the app etc. \\n\\nTIA. Hi all,\\n\\nAfter years of fiddling with iphone photography and an old school analogue camera I\\'m finally buying an entry level camera. I\\'m a beginner with some understanding of settings and am looking for a camera with which to grow and learn. I will use it 80% for photos, a solid video capability is a plus. Another big plus is seamless wifi/phone connectivity.\\n\\nI would mainly be using the camera for travel so I don\\'t want it to be too heavy. I have a trip to Namibia coming up soon where I reckon I\\'ll need some form of a telephoto lens to get some wildlife shots hopefully without breaking the bank completely.\\n\\nI have been looking into some entry level kits:\\n\\n* CANON EOS R50 + RF-S 18-45MM + RF-S 55-210MM\\n* NIKON Z50 + DX 16-50 VR + 50-250 VR\\n* SONY A6100 + 16-50 + 55-210\\n\\nOn the other hand, I could also get a used M50 mk II for \\\\~500€ (including a 15-45 kit lens ) and pair it up with a Tamron 100-400 for roughly the same budget. However, with the cannons I find the lack of weatherproofing might be problematic not really due to rain but more due to dust.\\n\\nMy budget is about 1200-1300€ (camera+lens).\\n\\nWhat would you recommend for me?. I’ve been a Fujifilm X-T3 owner for a few years now, and after shooting a couple events recently (with the 23mm f/2 and 50mm f/1), I’ve found myself frustrated with the X-T3’s AF and battery life. I feel tempted to go back to my first brand, Nikon, with the Z6ii and f/1.8 prime lenses. \\n\\nDoes anyone have experience with these two cameras (or Fujifilm and Nikon mirrorless overall)? How do the AF and battery life compare to each other?. I have a Canon 5d II that I have been shooting on for almost 10 years with two main lenses, 2.8 [16-35 & 70-200] and a handful of other random stuff. Recently I took it on a trip and I found myself shooting on it the first few days then I didn\\'t touch it for the rest of the trip. The bulkiness compared to my iPhone 12 was the true tell that I needed something more mobile and versatile. \\n\\nI debated for many years for the mk 3, or now the mk 4 since the weight drop is notable. But after seeing so many more Sonys / Canons on trips I started to debate my options. \\n\\nI know a lot of people have made the switch to Sony for portability and film. However film has never been a factor for me. I mostly shoot stills, outdoor and nightlife/lowlight. I would like to keep my lenses. But I am not seriously attached to them since they are both v1\\'s and they are heavy AF. I just would like to keep my budget under $3000 and a new Sony would have me on the market for a lens also. I also have heard/seen the grip on Sonys is almost unusable for long shoots and a grip upgrade is a must. \\n\\nFor the people who have made the switch, how have your old lenses held up with the adapters? Or have you phased everything out?\\n\\nShould I also consider some of Canons other lines?\\n\\nLastly should I even consider mirrorless? Or is this even too much of an ask?. I will keep it short and simple... I would like to branch out from taking photos on my iPhone and start taking pictures with a camera and adding to our family memories (and now that I am in the financial spot and place in life to do so) I have been researching endlessly which camera I should buy but quiet frankly I am overwhelmed from my research. Any suggestions are welcome based on the following:\\n\\n\\\\-I would like to stay between $1000-$1500\\n\\n\\\\-I am not interested in taking videos just really detailed photos such as newborn pictures, pictures of my toddler, family pictures, etc.\\n\\n\\\\-I would like for the sensor to be APS-C or full frame (would eventually like to print some out) \\n\\n\\\\-Prefer 4k & AF (but not a deal breaker if your suggestion doesn\\'t have that)\\n\\n\\\\-I have researched endlessly and am leaning towards the Sony Alpha A6400 with a 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS Lens... does this seem like a good investment?. I\\'ve owned a bunch of cameras over the years and they\\'ve all either died or become obsolete. I\\'m looking for a small camera (put in a coat pocket) for basic photography (nature, portrait, food, sunsets, etc.). I\\'d like to spend under US$750 if possible but can be persuaded to go to $1k if I can get something special. I\\'ll be buying a new camera. Bonus points for an attractive camera. \\n\\nI\\'ve been using my iPhone 12 for the past year and have been impressed by the quality of the pictures it takes. Does it make sense to get a dedicated camera? I\\'ve tried looking at online reviews but sites like the Wirecutter haven\\'t really updated their recommendations for what I think I\\'m looking for in years. \\n\\nThanks for your help!. Hello all! \\n\\nI\\'m looking for a camera to start at photography as a hobby. I\\'ve always wanted to buy a camera but I\\'ve also let that thought disappear, never thinking about it too much.\\n\\nI\\'ve been searching and comparing cameras, but once I had one and was about to buy it, I come to Reddit searching for info and, most of the time, it is like \"I would save and buy (xxx), it\\'s a huge improvement...\", so back to the entry point again.\\n\\nMy options right now are:\\n- Canon EOS 550D. ~130€ with the 18-55 kit lens. An old camera, I know, but pretty decent I think. Also, DSLR objectives are cheaper to find.\\n\\n- Fujifilm XT10. 370€ with the 16-50 kit lens. Love the look of the camera. Also an oldie, but it can get good results. This is the \"get the XT20 since is a huge improvement over XT10\".\\n\\n- Fujifilm XT100. ~340€. Includes Super EBC XC 16-45, grips, batteries, grips. Better than the XT10, but also I\\'ve read here in reddit that is a cheap and weathered down version of the XT20. *sigh*\\n\\n- Fujifilm XT20. Struggling with seller. 400-470€ is the price range. I\\'d be the third owner, includes XC 35mm primal lens.\\n\\nSo, this is where I am. I\\'d really like to start at photography, but this search is giving me headaches lol\\n\\nEDIT (copied from comments): Hey, some update over here. I ended up buying the XT-20 with the 35mm F2 for 440€ shipped. Not a HUGE deal but I think it\\'s pretty neat. I\\'m really enjoying it. I hope I can post some photos soon.\\n\\nThank you all for the advices!. So finally transitioned from the iPhone 12 to a decent mirrorless camera (thanks to this guy - **Mark Bennett\\'s Camera Crisis**) I mostly use this for vlogging and street/landscape videos to record the places I travel to. Also some portraits and street photos and landscapes. I am looking for some lens recommendations for you guys.I want to have Optical stabilisation (OSS) because I will be shooting handheld and mostly walking.This is just for hyper-causal recording and nothing professional. Maybe someday host it on youtube, that is the most I will do.I am tight on budget so looking for a balance between price and quality.Not strict, but if small and lightweight, I would be so happy.These are the lenses I saw on youtube  \\n**Wide**  \\nsigma 16 f1.4 - same focal length as my iPhone main camera (24mm)  \\nViltrox 13 f.14\\n\\n**Human eye**\\n\\nsigma 30 f1.4  \\n\\n\\nsigma 18-50 f2.8-  perfect IMO but no OSS. :(\\n\\nThanks in advance.\\n\\nYou can see this example of the type of videos I shoot mostly.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAAxRqIEMCg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAAxRqIEMCg)  \\n\\n\\n&#x200B;. I don\\'t know much about cameras or lenses, trying to take some portraits as I travel a lot and my iPhone camera not doing them justice. I bought this used XT-20 with a 16-50 lens. Any recommendation of what would be a good choice of a lens for portraits, that\\'s compact and lower than $300?\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndwrj9g4dcpa1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efcf3992b739cde3da2c908d36f9879265e3d9d1. Hey guys, i’m 16, i’ve taken an arts class before where we learned some basic photography stuff but other than that and taking photos with my iphone, I am a complete beginner. I’m looking for a cheap used camera and lens that I can learn everything on. I say cheap because i’m not sure if i’ll stick with photography or not. I’m looking at used cameras like the cannon rebel and cannon xt as these are cheap. I’m looking to spend under 300 on a used camera and lens i know it’s not much but feel free to give recommendations that are pricier. feel free to recommend different brands.. I\\'m on what feels like an endless search for my next camera after having my Canon Rebel T1i for the past 13 years. I\\'m ideally seeking a camera **lighter weight than an SLR, mirrorless, sharp/quick autofocus, built-in flash, and in-body image stabilization (IBIS)**. \\n\\nOriginally, I\\'d considered the **Fujifilm X-T30 II**, but it lacks IBIS and cannot be used as a webcam. I then looked at the **X-T5** or **X-S10** because both have IBIS. However, the X-S10 has only a 1.04M resolution screen, which I find to be rather pixelated, and it feels like a dated model since it launched over 2 years ago. I\\'ve heard the X-T5\\'s autofocus doesn\\'t compare to Sony\\'s. \\n\\nSo I\\'ve started to shift from considering Fujifilm to Sony because I\\'ve heard good things about the Sony AF performance and the impressive resolution of their screens. The Sony A7R V has a 2.1M screen, but is heavier and more expensive than I prefer. \\n\\nIf the X-S10 had a higher res screen, I think it would be the perfect camera for me. Does anyone know of a comparable Sony or even Canon model to the X-S10 but with a higher res screen?. Hi! \\n\\nI am currently looking to exchange my old Nikon D5000 (+ 35 mm f/1.8 + 24-120 f/4) with a newer camera system. I have the iPhone 14 pro which I find OK for everyday snapshots and videos, always with me and discreet. \\n\\n I have looked at the Nikon Z50, but found it a bit on the larger side. The Canon M50 II seemed very attractive to me due to its size, but then I read that it has been discontinued and I got a bit unsure.\\n\\nI primarily want to photograph my baby and family, mostly on special occasions, private photoshoots and on holidays. At the moment I don\\'t think I\\'ll buy more lenses, maybe a prime lens. \\n\\nRealistically there will be lots of times I won\\'t bring the camera, but use my phone instead so I don\\'t want to spend more than necessary. Where I live the price for the Z50 w/16-50 is currently equivalent to $1160 and the Canon M50 mk II w/15-45 is roughly $760, so the Canon has an advantage there.\\n\\nI would say that being compact (ie actually being brought and used) is of utmost importance, but I don\\'t want to compromise too much on the focus speed and quality I enjoyed with my DSLR. Any suggestions? \\n\\nAll advice highly appreciated, thanks.. \\nCanon R 6ii or a Sony 7 IV?\\n\\nI shoot with a Canon 6D with battery pack, 24-70mm 2.8, & the 16-35mm 2.8 for concert photography. This is not what I do for a living but for fun to give back to the music scene.\\n\\nI was thinking of upgrading to either a Canon R 6ii or a Sony 7 IV. Because this is NOT how I make a living, whatever direction I go with, I am going to live with for a while.\\n\\nQuestions: 1) Which camera should I get? Canon R 6ii or a Sony 7 IV?\\n\\n2) After upgrading, should I keep my old EF glass or start all over? Does getting an adapter for my EF lenses make sense & do they auto-focus well with an adapter?\\n\\n3) Is it easy for a Canon user to switch to Sony?\\n\\n4) If it makes more sense to get rid of my EF glass & start over, are 3rd party lens companies like Sigma & Tamron okay if on a tight budget? Or stick with my EF glass. Do EF lenses with an adapter work just as good?\\n\\n 5) Should I just buy an IPhone 14 since most of the bands I shoot for only use my photos for social media? lol (Somewhat serious, yes I understand smaller sensor but if it aready looks good then I don’t need to edit)\\n\\n6) Do I keep my older camera as a backup or sell it?\\n\\n7) A retired Union Tribune photographer swears by the Sony & says that Sony has a Rep who can help set up the camera from Canon users. Anyways, just wondering what your opinion on the matter would be? Thank You\\n\\nJust want to know people’s options on the matter.\\n\\n\\nThank You. I have a Canon M50 (with kit lens) for some time now and at some point I was thinking of buying something will a Full Frame sensor because I like how the depth of field looks like and I noticed a better image overall (I have a friend that has some Sony camera and I compared photos).\\n\\nHowever, over time, I noticed that I only use the camera to shoot promo photos for my side gig (which happens on rare ocasions) and when I go on vacation.\\n\\nMy goals is to have a set of portable devices that complement each other. Eg: I use the phone only for video and the camera only for photos (I will not take the camera out just to make an Instagram story, of course).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy questions are:\\n\\n1. Is the Canon M50 (with kit lens) better in terms of image quality comparted to the iPhone 13 Pro in a way that is distingusable in social media like Facebook and Instagram? \\n   1. *if I need to look very close at the image then the difference is not significant*\\n   2. *I rarely take pictures of landscapes; mostly people or objects*\\n2. Do you think it\\'s worth it to just upgrade the lens on the camera? (this would put the camera\\'s overall price quite close to the iPhone, if I buy the lens new - did some research and they are quite expensive and used ones are very rare)\\n   1. *instead of upgrading the lens I could take into account the upgrade to a full frame, if that is better, as it would be kind of the same update cost*. I don\\'t know much about cameras, but I\\'m considering getting a really nice one instead of using my iPhone for photos, or my Canon G7X.\\n\\nMy next camera doesn\\'t have to be Sony. I just see these three cameras recommended often. \\n\\nI run an online personal training and nutrition coaching business. The camera will be used for fitness related content on social media, mainly Instagram and Facebook, along with videos and photos for things I provide my clients with.\\n\\nI\\'d like to use this to update my exercise video library for clients, and get better quality videos. \\n\\nI provide clients with an online recipe book for meal ideas, so I\\'d also like to get higher quality photos of food/meals.\\n\\nContent posted to social media will mainly be videos of exercises, photos of me, photos of food, and videos of me talking. \\n\\nI thought I\\'d share that because I\\'m not sure if the type of photos and videos one plans on using the camera for would impact the camera recommendation. Like outdoor photography of landscapes vs. wedding photos vs. food, etc. \\n\\nPrice isn\\'t an issue.\\n\\nAnd last thing, lenses. Would the camera itself with no additional lenses be sufficient (great quality)? Or do you recommend I look into lenses too? \\n\\nWhat are your guys\\' experiences with these cameras, and which would you recommend for what I\\'m using it for?\\n\\nThanks!. So I have Samsung Galaxy Note 9 which I use for indoor product photography (I have a small shopping site). The mobile is excellent and its camera gets the job done BUT I have noticed in some cases it doesn\\'t show accurate colors and sometime colors are very poor.  \\n\\nSo I wanted to upgrade and get a digital camera for e.g. Canon SX 640 HS but then I noticed that sensor size of Canon SX 640 HS is 6.16 x 4.62 mm while that of Note 9 is 22.932 mm2.  \\n\\nEven Canon 2000D DSLR has a sensor size of 22.3 x 14.9mm which seems smaller than Note 9.  \\n\\nDoes it mean Note 9 has a bigger sensor size which means better pictures? Then my question is what\\'s the point of these digital cameras/DSLR whose sole purpose is to take photos/videos when a mobile phone camera is better then them?  \\n\\nOr may be I am reading it wrong?. Age old question, I know, but hear me out.\\n\\nI got started with film photography and still really enjoy the manual process of shooting, developing, and wet printing. I shoot with my trusty Nikon FE and hefty Mamiya C330f, and I love them to death, but I’d love to experiment with a lighter (more digital) workflow. One where I don’t always have to go through analogue processes for a digital end-goal.\\n\\nMy current digital assets include my iPhone 12 Pro and a Canon Rebel XTi + kit lens that fell into my lap recently for the lovely price of free. It hails from the distant year of 2006, possesses a gobsmacking competitive edge of a 10.1 megapixel crop sensor, and did I mention I got it for free?\\n\\nAnyways, I know that a larger sensor (even APSC) means, among other things, a vastly greater dynamic range to edit, which yields a better photo so long as I’m willing to do my time in post. BUT, with the 12 Pro’s lidar sensor to help inform nighttime photography, and all of the recent Apple software updates concerning photography such as Apple ProRAW, and my desire to not spend the remainder of my youth polishing turds in Lightroom, is it still worth it to be using a Canon Rebel XTi when it’s nearly 2023?\\n\\nTL;DR: Are Apple’s algorithmic witchcraft and ProRAW potential better than this DSLR released one year after the birth of YouTube?. Hi all,\\n\\nso recently I\\'ve been shooting on my iPhone 13 - now I want an actual proper camera. This will certainly be a full frame mirrorless because I don\\'t want to get stuck in 10 years with a DSLR when I can\\'t find any lens\\' for it. The main cameras I have in mind are the Nikon Z7II and also the Sony A7 IV. I\\'m unsure which one to get, and I know the Nikon is more expensive, but is it worth it? Will it make a difference?\\n\\nThe second thing that I\\'m still deciding on is the lens. I\\'ll mainly use this camera for astrophotography and landscape 16:9. My questions are:\\n\\n1. What focal length is good for Landscapes?\\n2. What focal length is good for Astrophotography?\\n3. Should I get 2 prime lenses (one for landscapes and another for astro) or just one zoom lens for both categories?\\n\\nThanks guys, any answers greatly appreciated.. Hi all,\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am in the market for a camera and thought I would ask for some input.  \\nI am a complete novice when it comes to camera hardware.  \\nmy background is in professional videography (started as a camera operator and moved into master control) I am also experienced in post processing video and stills so I am familiar with most of the concepts and the general industry but have no experience whatsoever with still photography equipment and it seems like a completely different beast so far but a good still camera is much cheaper than a good video camera and has the added benefit of, well, being a really good still camera as well, not too mention the sheer fun of learning something new.  \\n\\n\\nMy use cases are that my wife is working on a youtube channel and I would like to help out with the technical aspect of it so this is an amateur non paid endeavor.  \\nI would be doing mostly video, fairly close up static shots. (Mostly of her hands while she makes dresses and such but extreme close up isnt needed really)  \\nbut I would also be occasionally doing photo/video for fashion show events (Mostly outdoors) and some non profit events as a distant secondary requirement (Mostly indoor theater) aside from her stuff.\\n\\nbullet point requirements/non issues:\\n\\n* I dont really care too much about size, smaller is better but I wont be holding it for long periods or trekking with it.\\n* I do need clean HDMI out\\n* I either need the lens that comes with it to be versatile enough to handle what I use it for or lenses to be reasonably priced, either way is fine.\\n* I cant go above $550 for camera and lens to start but can buy additional lenses later.\\n* I prefer something that captures better source for post processing as thats where my strength is rather than a better up front out of the camera picture, though all of the models I listed will probably be fine either way\\n* my thoughts are that I probably wont need a lot of lenses for what I do and most anything on this list will be somewhat overkill in which case I\\'m leaning toward the A6000 for the video but if you all feel future lens replacement should still be at the forfront I am leaning toward the Canon rebel series because of the lens price (let me know if I\\'m wrong there)\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nMy budget is definitely in the novice range at $550\\n\\nThe models I am looking at are all used:\\n\\n* Sony A6000 $415 used with a Sony E 3.5-5.6/PZ 16-50 OSS lens\\n* Sony A5100 $399 (Almost unused 330 shutter actuations) with a Sony E 3.5-5.6/PZ 16-50 OSS lens\\n* Nikon D3500 $400 with AF-S NIKKOR 35mm 1.18G lens and AF-P NIKKOR 18-55mm 1:3.5-5.6G lens\\n* Canon T6S $450 with 18-55 lens\\n* Canon T6i $370 with EF-S 18-55mm IS STM Lens\\n* Canon EOS R (Almost unused) $450 with Canon zoom lens EF-S 18-55mm 1:3.5 - 5.6 IS STM\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe last one (EOS R) seems like a steal, however, my understanding is that the lenses are way more expensive for that model, if I got that one I\\'d probably be stuck with the lens it comes with for quite a long time if not indefinitely.\\n\\nI\\'m leaning toward the A6000 because of my need for video, I can easily live without audio input, however the price of the lenses for the Canon rebel series are a lot cheaper than the rest which draws me that direction a bit.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts?  \\nif there are other models in that pricerange you feel would be a good fit feel free to throw them in there as well.. I will be taking pictures that may be printed quite large so detail/sharpness is important to me.\\n\\nWhat would get me more detail, an iPhone 12 Pro or the Sony a6000 with 16-50 kit zoom (at high shutter speed and f/8)? How much sharper would a cheap prime be eg the sigma 30mm f2.8 than the kit lens?\\n\\nAlso if anyone has example images of what images look like with this config, that would be highly appreciated.\\n\\nThanks!. What’s a regular point and shoot camera that’s has similar features as the iPhone 12 Pro Max? I’m looking for a camera like this that doesn’t have the same price tag but also has mounts for a tripod and for a hot shoe flash.\\n\\nUpdate: I previously said that my budget is around $500 but I see now that was some wishful thinking. Now I’d be willing to pay more just as long as it doesn’t cost as much as an actual iPhone 12 Pro Max.. I am new to photography, and want to my buy first camera. I plan to shoot portraits, street photography, and maybe landscapes. I want the best bang for my buck. My budget is $500, and I\\'ve been looking at the Nikon D3500 with a 18-55mm lens and a 70-300mm lens for $500. I heard it\\'s a great beginner DSLR. However, I\\'ve been hearing the Sony a6000 is really good too, and it seems like mirrorless cameras are becoming a huge thing. I could get the a6000 with a 16-50mm lens for $500 as well. The battery life is a huge turn off though (and to be honest, I don\\'t really like the design, even though that doesn\\'t really matter lol). Which camera should I get? Thanks!. Hey there.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to be new parents in a few weeks\\' time and we want to get one/two cameras to make sure we capture as many memories as possible. Neither of our parents could afford anything like that when we were young, so we don\\'t have many (or any, in my wife\\'s case) childhood pictures.\\n\\nNowadays we have decent jobs and can afford to buy something - and I don\\'t want to regret **not** doing so in a few years\\' time.\\n\\nWe would like to get suggestions for some cameras that would allow us to shoot both stills and videos easily (as non-photographers). We recently sold our 60D and lenses, and currently don\\'t have a camera.\\n\\nWe\\'d be shooting pictures/videos indoors and outdoors - in summer, winter, and autumn - and would be mostly shooting handheld (so probably need IBIS?). We want something with the best/easiest autofocus possible (especially in video) because we\\'ll use cameras a lot more often if they\\'re convenient - and kids don\\'t stay still! We\\'ll also be using it to shoot our kittens.\\n\\nWe\\'d also really love 4K just for archival purposes so the footage holds up well over time.\\n\\nWe were thinking of getting 2 cameras:\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n * One compact/pocket-sized primarily for stills so we can take it everywhere - ideally with a flip screen so we can see ourselves.\\n * Smaller-than-DSLR mirrorless camera - still easy to travel with, but better performance. Would be good to have a flip screen, but not necessary.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nDoing some research, we\\'ve come across the following:\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Compact**\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n * Canon G7x ii\\n * Sony RX 100 (not sure which versions would work?)\\n * Fujifilm X100F\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Mirrorless**\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n * Sony a6500\\n * Fujifilm X-T3 // X-T2\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s the Canon M50 somewhere in between... Semi-small and compact, flip screen... What about AF for video? Does the sony beat it?\\n\\nWe would love some suggestions or real-world experience comparisons of the avove cameras. We don\\'t really know how they weigh up...\\n\\nWe\\'re leaving towards the Sony a6500 + RX100 combo, but I\\'m not sure if we\\'re missing any obvious options.  How do the RX100s and G7x ii match up? The G7x is wider, but the AF looks suuuuper slow. How does the Sony do? What about the Canon M50? Which versions of the RX100 would work? Fuji do regular updates - how\\'s the autofocus for videos as of today?. i\\'m looking to buy a \"\"real camera\"\" to upgrade from my smartphone \\n\\ni wanted something fairly compact and affordable, that would have better pictures than my smartphone (iphone 11)\\n\\nis this a good camera? https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-a3\\n\\nit\\'s being sold for $478 currently \\n\\n\\nanother thing, it comes with a \"16-50mm\" lens, and i have absolutely no idea what that means 😃, would appreciate any help. This is my first post/comment here. I\\'m not a professional (or even amateur) photographer, but I do enjoy taking nice photos and having fun. I also have a terrible case of over-analyzing every purchase I make, so please bear with me while I try to talk through where I\\'m at with my decision making process, and what I could use advice on. I also realize that this sub probably gets a decent amount of these questions, so please excuse my rather lengthy post because I\\'m trying to show that I have in fact put effort into this.\\n\\n# Background\\n\\nMy primary uses for a dedicated camera (aside from a smartphone) are when my wife and I are traveling or portraits at family gatherings. We also have our first baby on the way and while I\\'m at home I would like to document a lot of those first few months, as well as have something to use as they grow up. I imagine we\\'ll like to get things like the baby\\'s first steps on video.\\n\\nOur current camera is a Nikon 1 J3 which, while nice and compact has left us wanting a little more out of our next camera. It has a 10-30mm (27-81mm FF equivalent) lens. I\\'d like to be able to get better photos indoors if possible. I\\'d also like access a cheaper prime lenses. A dedicated 50mm equivalent for portraits and a wide angle prime for landscapes when traveling would probably serve us well.\\n\\nI was dead set on upgrading to the Sony a6400 because I like the compact size, the lens lineup, and what sounds like a stupid-proof AF system. That was until I started reading about the Fujifilm XT-30 and how popular it is among enthusiasts and professionals alike. The idea of physical buttons sounds like it would make for a more fun experience, and might encourage me to bring it out more often.\\n\\n# Lenses\\n\\nFor the initial purchase, I was just hoping to buy a standard zoom kit lens. If we went with the Sony, I was planning on buying it with the 18-135 f/3.5-5.6. If we went with the Fuji, I\\'d get the 18-55 f/2.8-4. Both lenses have OIS/OSS and bring the price for the camera and lens to $1300.\\n\\nObviously the Sony has a longer zoom and the Fuji has a wider aperture. The Nikon lens we are coming from (10-30mm focal length) has the same equivalent focal length as the Fujifilm, so I\\'d probably be more familiar with that, but I\\'m unsure if the extra reach of the 18-135 would be useful for things like any future kids sporting events.\\n\\nAfter the standard zoom, I\\'d probably plan on buying a 50mm equivalent prime before the baby is born. The Sony lineup has both the Sigma 30 f/1.4 and the Sony 35 f/1.8 OSS. The Fuji has a 30 f/1.4. Pricing is similar, but the Sony options are cheaper.\\n\\n# Differences\\n\\nThe main differences between these cameras that I\\'m aware of that I\\'m trying to weigh in my head are the ergonomics, AF system, the SOOC image quality.\\n\\nObviously each camera has different design philosophies. Without having held either, I really don\\'t know which I\\'d prefer. The Nikon J3 we are coming from is certainly more like the Sony. Are there in-store locations I can go to to try out the X-T30?\\n\\nThe AF system on the Sony is what initially drew me to the A6400. Neither my wife or I are great photographers, so the ability to be able to try and capture a moment and just get it right is important to us. I\\'ve read the X-T30 has received firmware updates which have improved the AF (I actually really like that Fuji seem to be supporting their APS-C lineup with frequent firmware and lens updates,) but it\\'s still not on the same level as the Sony.\\n\\nThe SOOC image quality is also incredibly important to us. So far I haven\\'t made the jump to shooting in RAW. I would like to at some point, but for a host of reasons I just haven\\'t yet. In the future, if it were made easy to edit RAW in a mobile app like Snapseed I could see myself touching up key photos, but for now we\\'ve only messed with JPG. I\\'ve read the Fuji really shines in this area, and that their in camera image processing is great.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nI\\'m torn, and while I\\'m sure either option will serve me well, I\\'m not really sure where or how to go about deciding. Any insight or experiences, feedback, or other things to consider would be greatly appreciated.. Hi folks.\\n\\nI\\'m planning an upgrade for my aging Canon EOS M50, which has been pretty much neglected by Canon in the interim. With no light on the horizon for the M series, I\\'m looking for the next big step for my gear and am willing to spend a little more money this time for a more advanced camera. Price range: 1500-2500 EUR.\\n\\nBut to be honest, I\\'m a bit overwhelmed with the existing and upcoming models and can\\'t identify a clear favorite.  \\n\\n\\n1. Panasonic GH5 Mark 2 - The GH5 is one of the most common allrounders for content creators. The update seems quite nice, but stands in the shadow of the\\n2. Panasonic GH6 - which is not yet released but looks quite good on paper. Also probably quite expensive.\\n3. Sony Alpha 7 IV - Also an update to a very common camera, but expensive\\n4. Canon R6 - Not sure what to think about the camera from a videographers PoV\\n5. BMPCC 6K - A little bit cheaper and specialization on video, but also not very good for run & gun activities without proper gimbal. Good for me: Most of my stuff is recorded in my home studio. Also Canon Mount\\n6. Apple iPhone 13 - Seems weird, but the new camera seems very powerful - especially for regular video stuff. Any experiences?  \\n\\n\\nAny recommendations?. So i\\'m new to the whole camera thing and I want to make videos like this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ55komYQ_w). I know how to edit. It\\'s not that hard but I have no idea what camera to get. The guy at bestbuy suggested this [a6000](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Digitial-3-0-Inch-16-50mm/dp/B00NO1T55I/ref=sxin_3_ac_d_rm?ac_md=0-0-YTYwMDA%3D-ac_d_rm&crid=1UUQ445YK1AUU&cv_ct_cx=a6000&keywords=a6000&pd_rd_i=B00I8BICB2&pd_rd_r=033620f9-3980-4aaa-b7c7-a32f5c663883&pd_rd_w=BBKEC&pd_rd_wg=CK3VH&pf_rd_p=e2f20af2-9651-42af-9a45-89425d5bae34&pf_rd_r=YM0V1BEW66RXAW6ZVE1B&qid=1578017326&sprefix=a600%2Caps%2C156&th=1) with the 2 lenses. I need to be able to see the entire rink (about 200 ft). I also wouldn\\'t mind taking photos too. Any suggestions would be great and I\\'m open to buying something used. Hoping to keep in the a6000 price range. Thanks. Is sony a7 III with non-OIS 28-70 better than this?. I\\'ve grown beyond taking pictures with my iPhone (some of which I\\'ve actually sold) and want to get into taking actual portraits and self portraits that look nice.\\n\\nI\\'ve been looking at the Nikon D5600 or the Sony Alpha a5100. Which one would you guys recommend? I\\'m considering these two because they have a flip screen that I can use to see what the camera sees from a position in front of the camera. There is also the a6100 that looks nice, but that\\'s a little bit out of my budget range. I was hoping to stretch my dollar so I can spend on a tripod, lenses etc.\\n\\nThe Nikon with an 18-55mm lens is more expensive with a than the Sony with a 16-50mm lens. I really have no idea what the different lenses will do, so any input would be really appreciated!. I’m planning to get a new camera for my wife’s birthday. She’s mentioned she’d like to get into photography on a few occasions and we are expecting our first kid this spring. To be clear, she hasn’t explicitly asked for a camera and this will be a surprise, so I don’t know how much it will end up getting used but I think it will be appreciated.  We are both COMPLETE beginners who only use iPhone XS cameras at the moment.\\n\\nI was originally going to go simple and get a Nikon D3500 (thinking I’d spend $400-500), but have read enough on here to convince myself that mirrorless is likely the way to go. Her father has a Sony a6000 and owns several telephoto lenses and suggested I get her a mirrorless Sony, which seems to be relatively highly recommended on here.\\n\\nThe extra expense of the Sony a6100 with the AF features, semi articulating screen, and slightly better image quality seem worth the extra money to me vs an older a6000. An a6100 is currently $699 with the 16-50mm kit lens brand new. I’ve considered used as well, but since it’s a gift I’d prefer a new one assuming the price isn’t way out of these ranges.\\n\\nQuestion: Now I’m confused about the a6100 vs the a6400, mainly due to the build quality (weather sealed) and better EVF. How much do these matter for beginners? Is weather sealed really useful / necessary? What are the work arounds for using a camera in light rain if I get her the a6100? Is the build quality of an a6400 much better for having this around a small kid?  The a6400 with the same kit lens is currently $999, so the extra $300 isn’t insignificant and again, I have no idea how much she’ll use this (other than likely pictures of our baby) and I’ve already increased the budget to go mirrorless.\\n\\nAlso, her father has some telephoto lenses already. Are there any decent second lenses I should consider regardless of body?\\n\\nThanks for any advice - I’ve searched through this a lot and have read a lot about the a6000 but haven’t seen as much about the a6100 vs a6400 trade offs for a true beginner.. Hi, I\\'ll start out by saying I know very little about cameras. I went to my local electronics store today and talked to a sales person about cameras for 20 minutes and maybe understood 25% of what they were saying.\\n\\nWith that out of the way,  I have been extremely lucky. Over the past 4 years, I have been building a webstore and this past year has gone very well. I have about 300 items listed and In this next year I would like to double my listings. Up till this point, I have really only been using my iphone X camera. About a month ago my sister let me borrow her old cannon t5i with some basic lens. It has been better than the iphone (obviously), but the image quality still isnt as good as I would like. This webstore has recently become my full time job, and I want my listings to have a professional look. \\n\\nThe items I take pictures of range from the size of a quarter to the size of your hand. When buyers see the pictures I take, they have the option to zoom in on them. My pictures quickly become blurry when they do this. I would like them to remain crisp even when zoomed in, if possible. \\n\\nWhat camera and lens do you think would be best? Honestly, Im not opposed to spending several grand if you think it would help. The business has been doing very well and I could write this off as an expense. I hate to be that person who comes into a community thinking that throwing money at it will magically make them good at something. But I plan on publishing \\\\~2100 listing photos for the 300 new listings and also should update old listing photos. For that reason, Id really like to give myself every advantage possible so I dont have to redo them. Im also ready to spend a significant amount of time learning the camera and editing software.\\n\\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thank you!.  \\n\\nHey guys! I\\'m totally new to photography (I\\'m as much as a retard when it comes to photography) and won\\'t actually be enthusiastic about it anyway (but never say never). But please hear me out here.\\n\\nI\\'m in the market for a new mid-range camera as a marriage proposal gift to my gf (of course its packaged with a ring!). But being a camera noob, I didn\\'t have a good time understanding some of the camera reviews out there. So I\\'m thinking its best that I post it here on Reddit to obtain more personalized opinion/guidance.\\n\\nHere are my requirements for the new camera:\\n\\n1. My gf is starting her own bakery/pastry business so she needs a good camera to take nice photos for product showcase as well as occasional short product videos. She\\'s been taking photos with her iPhone 7 Plus which hasn\\'t been exactly pleasant so far.\\n2. She always wanted a good camera for herself, to use on friend outings, family events, trips etc. It\\'s pretty much meant for general/universal photography. But because of financial constraints, she hasn\\'t do that yet.\\n3. I\\'m planning to shoot a short proposal surprise video for her that will mostly include her friends and family and maybe some \"in-the-making\" of proposal preparations.\\n4. All in all, would like a good camera for general purpose, that\\'s beginner friendly, not just for her but also myself that I might use from time to time. Most probably don\\'t need to take fast action photoshoot or video.\\n\\nAfter a few months of on-and-off research and study, I\\'ve narrowed down the search into these 2 models (yes I know this has been asked MANY times, but I\\'m still torn between the 2). I\\'m also open to any other suggestions.\\n\\nThese are my current thoughts and stand to be corrected anytime as I\\'m obviously still have much to learn:\\n\\nPros of A6400\\n\\n* **Flip screens** \\\\- Easy for taking vlog-type videos (the proposal video) but this most probably gonna be a one-time usage. It\\'ll also be nice for her to take group selfies with her friends and family.\\n* **Smaller footprint** \\\\- I haven\\'t handle any of those cameras but smaller cameras are more portable. However, I\\'m not sure if this translates to better handle?\\n* **Autofocus** \\\\- From what I\\'ve read and watched, A6400 (and its siblings) has the best-in-class/market autofocus which is gonna be super helpful for beginner like myself, please correct me if I\\'m wrong here.\\n* **Better app** \\\\- Read that Sony has much better app solution compare to Fuji\\'s.\\n* **Longer videoshooting** \\\\- No time limit for videoshooting is nice (does this affect timelapse mode?) but X-T30\\'s 15 minutes limit on 1080p is good enough for what I foresee.\\n* **Price** \\\\- A6400 is about 250USD cheaper overall with the kit lens here in Malaysia.\\n\\nPros of X-T30\\n\\n* **Aesthetic** \\\\- She simply prefer the old-school camera look of X-T30\\n* **User-friendliness** \\\\- Was told that Fujifilm\\'s system menu is much less cluttered and more user-friendly overall.\\n* **Manual controls** \\\\- I dont know much about this but people seems to like the manual controls on the X-T30 and also thinks that this is good for beginners to learn photography.\\n* **Less post-processing time** \\\\- I read that Fuji cameras has great colour filters for photos and videos, this would be nice as I\\'m not a good photoshop/lightroom person myself either. But i don\\'t mind spending time on editing videos and photos because that seems fun.\\n* **USB-C charging** \\\\- Being a tech enthusiast, I\\'m picky when it comes to tech stuff. USB-C is a HUGE plus but not a deal-breaker at all. Although all of my gadgets are USB-C, but it\\'s no pain to bring another cable + adapter.\\n\\nQuestions\\n\\n* **Lens** \\\\- Like I said, I know nothing about camera and photography. For that, I\\'m seeing myself and my gf be sticking to one all-purpose lens for the time being, will only upgrade if we ever ourselves getting more into photography which a bit unlikely. Anyway, I read that the Fuji kit lens (16-55mm) is vastly superior (also as one of the best all-purpose lens out in the market) to the one that comes with Sony (16-50mm) but I kinda like the small form of the Sony\\'s lens. Or should I go for other lenses instead?\\n* Which camera is best for all purpose and good as a starter camera for beginners?\\n* Should I go for something cheaper first or the mid-rangers like X-T30/A6400 is a good one to start with?\\n\\nIs there any points that I should taking in consideration as well? Also feel free to suggest any good models that I should take a look at.\\n\\nSorry for the wall of text and really thank you so much for reading!\\n\\n**TLDR**\\n\\n\\\\- I\\'m an absolute beginner to photography.\\n\\n\\\\- Purpose : Need a camera for product shooting (photo and video) and one-time use for marriage proposal video. But it\\'s also for general purpose.\\n\\n\\\\- Needs a user-friendly camera  \\n\\\\- A6400 is much cheaper than the X-T30 (both with kitlens) here in my country.\\n\\n\\\\- Open to any other suggestion!\\n\\nSo which should I pick? Thanks!\\n\\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/jel5ma). EDIT: \\n\\nQuick update, I\\'m currently trying to reach someone from Olympus through Facebook. Any tips on how to reach them otherwise are still welcome!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis is a pretty long story so if you don\\'t want to read everything, here\\'s the TL;DR:\\n\\nTL;DR: Olympus service does not want anything to do with me, even though I\\'ve bought thousands worth of Olympus gear.\\n\\nStory time:\\n\\nFirst of all a couple disclaimers:\\n\\n* I am from the Netherlands (Europe), there may be some spelling mistakes in here. I apologize for that in advance;\\n* This story is very recent (most recent development was 28th of January), relevant because of the sale of Olympus;\\n* The camera grip was bought in Canada from Olympus Canada (in April of 2020);\\n* The camera body was bought in the Netherlands from an independent camera store (late November 2019).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlright so here we go:\\n\\nThe story started in April of 2020, I was in Canada for a few months and I decided to buy an Olympus HLD-8G camera grip for my Olympus OM-D E-M5 II. I bought it directly from Olympus CA (online) and everything was great.\\n\\nRight up until about August of 2020, by then I was already back in my home country of the Netherlands, when I started noticing that every so often the camera would not stop focusing until I took the picture (it was like the shutter was always half-pressed). Usually after a restart or a reseat of the grip it would be solved. I found it weird but did not think too much of it at that point.\\n\\nFast forward about a month, maybe six weeks...\\n\\nI started having the problem more and more up to the point where I\\'d have it practically every other time I switched the camera on. I tried everything from different (Olympus) lenses, batteries, using the touch screen, not using it... Nothing seemed to fix it. I updated the camera\\'s firmware, the lenses\\' firmware but nothing worked.\\n\\nThat\\'s when I contacted Olympus US/CA, asking if I \\\\*have\\\\* to send it to CA where I bought it or if I could just have it serviced where I live. This was October 22nd 2020 (keep this date in mind).\\n\\nGiven the circumstances, I also contacted my local Olympus service centre to see if they would have an answer for me.\\n\\nThe next day I got a reply from my local Olympus rep asking me to clarify some points, I sent a pretty specific email back saying exactly what my problems were and what I\\'d tried up until that point to try and fix it.\\n\\nA couple days later I get a response from the same rep saying that since I bought it in Canada they would possibly not be covered by warranty (even though it\\'s under INTL warranty) but to register it for repair via their online form in the My Olympus dashboard anyway, he said they\\'ll keep me posted before it would mean I\\'d have to pay for anything.\\n\\nThe same day I sign it up for repair through the online form (specifying it as an under warranty repair). I sent it out with their shipping label probably about a week later.\\n\\nA couple days later: the first response from the US/CA service department (mind you, it\\'s already been about 3 weeks since I\\'ve sent the first email) stating that I\\'d have to return it to the CA service centre to have it fixed under any type of warranty. I leave the US/CA contact for what it is and focus on the \\'local\\' rep from this point on.\\n\\nA few days later I get the notification from Olympus stating that my product has arrived at the service centre (I sent it to a local address, but that was actually not where it went in the end... It ended up in Portugal, over 2000 KM away).\\n\\n4 Days later, I get the notification that they\\'ve tested my grip and that they did not find any defects, requesting that if I wanted my grip tested properly I\\'d have to also send my camera in with it. They did not tell me how to make sure both repairs would get linked. I asked, it didn\\'t work. I registered my camera as a repair, specifically saying in the notes to link both ticket IDs so that it would end up in the same spot as my grip.\\n\\nBecause the repair registration process did not let me link the both together I also sent an email asking for the two to be linked.\\n\\nI sent out my camera in it\\'s original packaging (just like I did with my grip) and got the notification it was received at the service centre a couple days later.\\n\\nNow: NOTHING for a week. THEN: a notification from the shipping company saying there\\'s a package on it\\'s way back from Olympus (note that I have not received any updates either my request to link both repairs or status-updates for my camera or grip).\\n\\nA day later: the package arrives, it\\'s my camera body with a note that said they \\'cleaned\\' it and that there was nothing else done. The box reeked of smoke when I got it back, but at least my camera was back.\\n\\nI sent another email to the same rep as the one I had contact with before saying that I\\'d gotten my camera back but have not had any other form of contact or updates since (reached out this time December 18th 2020).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNOTHING FOR ANOTHER 3 WEEKS: I reach out again asking for an update about my grip, also mentioning that I\\'ve been waiting a very long time already with apparently nothing having been done to fix my issues and that if it were to take longer still they\\'d probably just send me a new one.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNOTHING FOR ANOTHER 2.5 WEEKS: I get a shipping notification a package from Olympus (Portugal) is arriving soon.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nA couple days later, the package arrives, the original box in worse shape than when I sent it out, the plastic protection that was over the connector pins on the grip missing and the grip badly packed inside the box.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\'Till this day, I have not had any updates regarding my tickets/repairs since November 23rd!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI would like to get this out there to show how horrible Olympus\\' service is (or has been to me at least) and if it gets enough attention, what they plan to do with it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso, for the record: I LOVE MY OLYMPUS gear, it\\'s amazing (if it works) and if I\\'d upgrade it would probably be an Olympus body as well, it\\'s just that the service seems to just be absolutely horrible.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFor the ones interested, I\\'ll also add the full contact log below:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nContact log Olympus:\\n\\n22 october 2020, first contact with Olympus about whether to send it to CA or keep it in NL, sending to US/CA contact (Me)\\n\\n23 october 2020, first answer from Olympus asking me what the question actually is (Olympus)\\n\\n23 october 2020, responding with elaborate explanation (Me)\\n\\n26 october 2020, response that the grip bought in CA has intl warranty meaning that I\\'d likely have to pay for the repair and to sign it up for repair anyway (Olympus)\\n\\n26 october 2020, I sign it up for repair via the website (specifying repair under warranty) (Me)\\n\\n12 november 2020, response from \\\\*FIRST CONTACT\\\\*(22 october), saying that I\\'ll have to return it to the country of origin to have any type of warranty (Olympus US/CA)\\n\\n16 november 2020, product arrived at Olympus service centre (Olympus)\\n\\n20 november 2020, product tested, no defect found. Request to send camera to test both (Olympus)\\n\\n21 november 2020, I respond confirming that the camera that was already linked to my Olympus account is the camera with which I had the problem, I ask how to link the repairs (Me)\\n\\n23 november 2020, response saying that I can send the camera as a separate repair, linking it to the original (does not specify how) (Olympus)\\n\\n24 november 2020, repair signed up confirmation (Olympus)\\n\\n10 december 2020, confirmation camera arrived at repair centre (Olympus)\\n\\n17 december 2020, DHL postal notification saying a package from Olympus is on it\\'s way back to me (NOTE: no updates from Olympus, no other contact since my last response)\\n\\n18 december 2020, I reach out again saying that I have my camera back, nothing had been done to it and the box in which it came smelled horrible (heavy some scent), also asking for an update on my grip, linking repairs apparently didn\\'t work (Me)\\n\\n9 january 2021, I reach out AGAIN asking for an update about my grip saying that I\\'d like to receive it back within a pretty short period or they\\'d be better off sending me a new one\\n\\n26 january 2021, DHL postal notification saying I have a package from Olympus (Portugal) arriving soon\\n\\n28 january 2021, parcel arrived, Olympus did not do anything to the grip and it seems to still occasionally have the same problem (the exact reason I sent it out for repair) (Me)\\n\\nUntil this day, I have not heard ANYTHING from them since november 23rd!. Going to try to compartmentalize this instead of writing an essay.\\n\\nCurrent kit: Fujifilm X-T3, 16-55 2.8, 50-140 2.8, 23 1.4, 27 2.8, 56 1.2. Approximate resale value $4,030.\\n\\nWhy I want to switch: \\n\\nThe X-T3 grip is atrocious and I want something actually designed for a human hand.\\n\\nAlmost all of my work is photojournalism and events and I end up using my 16-55 far more than my primes, but indoor usage at f2.8 and the minimum depth of field is disappointing and I want to improve that.\\n\\nFace/eye detect fails in complex social situations, regaining and losing faces faster than I can pick the one I want, leading to me just turning it off. Would like to see improvement there.\\n\\nI want improved battery life without buying a bulky grip.\\n\\n(Note, I do not shoot video so I don\\'t care about anything related to that)\\n\\nAdorama Education Pricing (w/ no sales tax):\\n\\nA7III: $1,600\\n\\nPros: Gets me most of what I want, better but not great grip, better high ISO performance and shallower DoF at f2.8, better face/eye AF, significantly better battery life. $2,430 left for glass.\\n\\nCons: Downgraded back screen and EVF. I lose my favorite feature on the X-T3, silent shooting with no consequences on image quality in any situation ever.\\n\\nA7RIII: $2,080\\n\\nPros: Everything I said about the A7III + 47MP, even better AF after firmware updates, and the EVF is on par with X-T3.\\n\\nCons: Grip isn\\'t any better than the A7III. Loses some battery life but still far better than the X-T3, imperfect silent shutter performance gets worse. $1,950 left for glass. \\n\\nA7RIV: $2,500\\n\\nPros: Everything I said about the A7III and A7RIII + 61MP, even better grip, even better EVF, even better AF, better buttons and dials, mechanical shutter is apparently much quieter which is a big deal for me because silent shutter is going to be basically useless with this much sensor to scan.\\n\\nCons: Oh my God the file sizes. $1,530 left for glass.\\n\\nEdit: Bought a used Sigma 24-70 for $1,000.\\n\\nQuestions: \\n\\nWhich body should I buy?\\n\\nWhat other lenses would you recommend with the remaining money and/or to save up for in the future?\\n\\nI\\'m conflicted. Looking at what I just wrote I think \"The RIV is absolutely worth $420 more than the RIII, but $900 more than a III?\" I\\'m not sure, I wouldn\\'t be excited to transition to a worse EVF than I have now and the RIV looks like it would solve every theoretical problem I would have with the III. Additionally bodies and lenses are inherently different financial propositions. I can always save up more money and buy more lenses once I have the body but if I find the body I choose to be lacking I would have to sell it at a loss in order to replace it. There\\'s also the eventual resale down the line. Three or four years from now would an A7III still be worth as close to $1,600 as an A7RIV will be worth to $2,500? However, spending more on the body limits my glass options. With the A7III I could pick up a 24 1.4, with the RIII I could get the 35 1.8, but with the RIV I’ll be lucky if I can squeeze in a used 55 1.8.\\n\\nAs you can probably tell I\\'m leaning towards buying the A7RIV and reducing my lens kit to a 24-70 and probably a wide-normal walk around prime until I can afford a telephoto zoom (hopefully Sigma will release one soon). However, this is a pre-purchase sanity check. Please, talk me out of it.. I have been taking pictures using the iPhone 7+ and am looking to upgrade, even though you can take some pretty good photo\\'s using the iPhone it seems! I used to own a mirrorless camera with my ex-wife which I liked but wanted to get some advice before buying the same one again. I believe it was a Fuji x100t. Would this be a safe route to go down for an amateur photographer? Should I stick to mirrorless or DSLR?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: **Sony Alpha a6000 mirrorless camera with 16-50mm and 55-210mm lenses.**. Hey guys. After deciding on the Sony a6000 as my first camera, I amstuck in a dilemma of choosing my first lens (apart from the kit lens) to use with the camera. I was going to get a 35mm lens since it has an aps-c sensor but it is way out of my budget at this moment in time. Not only that but the kit lens can cover that focal range since it’s a 16-50mm lens. I won’t be able to get the most shallow depth of field since it’s an aperture of 3.5-5.6 but it’ll be perfect enough until I can afford better glass.\\n\\nMy main focus is long exposure and macro photography but I aim to learn product photography, portraiture and car photography but not necessarily in that order or all at once. As a result of this, I need a lens that has a longer focal point (since the a6000 has an aps-c sensor the 50mm lens will act like a 75/80mm lens) to get those closer photos and that detail with some lovely bokeh. \\n\\nHowever, I’m struggling to decide between the FE or the OSS lens since the FE lens is selling for about £170 and the OSS lens is selling for about £215 on average. The cheapest I’ve found the FE model is for £164 and the cheapest I’ve found the OSS model is for £195. I will be only doing photography for the foreseeable future but who knows, I may decide to start doing videos too. Due to this I don’t know what lens would be better for my money out of the two since the OSS feature will be very valuable for video but it’s still fairly useful for photos. I’ve heard bad things about the FE model but I also heard that the issues were resolved in a firmware 3.0 update whereas I’ve not heard anything bad about the OSS model. \\n\\nNot only that but the OSS focuses faster and is a lot quieter. What I’m trying to ask is whether the ~£50 price difference for the lens is justifiable for these aforementioned reasons. \\n\\nFor now I’m going to be a beginner photographer but I aim to build a business in a few years time so I’d also like a lens that could last me for a long time. However, I also understand that this comes down to maintenance and how well I look after my products so I guess it was a pointless point. \\n\\nFor their prices, which of the 2 lenses is a better value for money?. I know very little about photography. That said, I use my iPhone 6s camera a minimum of 10 shots a day. On trips, I take anywhere from 500-1000 pictures. I don\\'t want to buy a starter $150 camera to learn how to use it. If I\\'m spending that much money, I want something I\\'m going to be happy with for at least a few years, so I may as well use it towards something else. I will be downgrading my phone next year and feel like I\\'ve outgrown camera phones anyways.\\n\\nI feel like I have a decent handle on composition (I\\'ve been drawing my whole life, a little architectural drafting experience), and my mother was a curator for a museum during my childhood (I got to meet Gordon Parks!). That said, I will never be a serious photographer. I want to care what I am shooting, but I also don\\'t want people to get weirded out that I busted out some fancy camera for what they\\'d see as a super casual shot (ie - no DSLR for me). I just want it to be my own little hobby that brings me happiness (that said, I want to become passionate about it, at least personally, and get to understand everything about the art form when time allows).\\n\\nThat hobby used to be drawing, but I haven\\'t drawn much in the last 3 years. I\\'ve noticed, however, that I tend to shoot a lot of pictures from my phone. \\n\\nThe majority of my shots will likely see no post processing. I\\'ll shoot pictures, put them on a private cloud share to share with friends, family or partner and perhaps post 1 photo a week on instagram or something. I may do a quick crop or apply a filter and that\\'s it. \\n\\n- Pocketable\\n- Superb picture quality \\n- Good in low light\\n- Good for portrait as well as macro shots\\n- Zoom capability only if no loss\\n- 16+ MP\\n- wifi capable\\n- $350-$700\\n\\nI\\'ve been looking at the Ricoh GR 2. Its inability to zoom has me slightly concerned, however I hate the loss seen when zooming in on some cameras. If there\\'s going to be loss of quality, I\\'d rather physically move closer to whatever I\\'m shooting. I saw someone note that GR was not ideal for low-light, but everything else I\\'ve read on it sounds great.\\n\\nI\\'d like less moveable parts, something durable. Something like the Panasonic Lumix L10 is not my speed I don\\'t think. I do not care about video, as much, and I don\\'t need a moveable view finder, so much. That\\'s another thing that intrigues me about the Ricoh GR 2 is that it seems like a durable little camera with not much moving parts.\\n\\nI\\'ve also been looking at the Canon Powershot G9X Mark II, as well as the G7. I want something DSLR quality-wise, so I\\'m leaning towards the Ricoh GR 2, but given that I know next to nothing about photography, I\\'m here seeking your wisdom. . We currently have a gently used Nikon D5100 with the 18-55mm VR kit lens that we bough in 2012. We used it for a couple years, then our iPhones became *good enough* because of convenience.  We want better memories now, before the kids are out of high school, so I started looking for a new lens that will give us the reach that we need for sports.   My son plays hockey, my daughter plays lacrosse and dances.  (Note: photography at dances recitals is only allowed during dress rehearsal, and the stage is over-lit and the entire theater is lit. It\\'s tough.)  \\n\\n\\nI\\'ve been reading reviews, specs, posts, about what we should do and I\\'m stuck.  I understand that it\\'s better to spend on good lenses, but I\\'m unsure if we should replace the body for something with a more modern processor.   Is 4.5fps fast enough?    \\n\\n\\nOur budget is up to $1500.  I\\'m not in a hurry, but we\\'d like to take whatever we buy on vacation with us in late July or early August.   There\\'s also summer hockey, so we can get some practice in with different gear if needed.   \\n\\n\\nOptions I\\'ve considered so far include:\\n\\n* Used Nikon 70-300mm VR (the older model that actually works with the D5100) for $350.  It gives us the reach, most affordable option.\\n* Sony A6000 16-50, 55-210 kit for $650 (also have the option to buy body only from a friend and pick up different glass)\\n* Nikon D7500 kit that includes 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 VR and 70-300mm f/4.5-6.3 G ED VR for $1000.  (this is the newer 70-300mm lens)\\n* Canon 80D kit that includes EF-S 18-55 IS STM and EF-S 55-250 IS STM lenses for $1100  \\n\\n\\nNikon also makes an 18-300mm f/3.5-6.3G ED VR that is not compatible with the D5100 (which sours me a bit on Nikon, honestly).  I could consider that and a newer body.  Canon doesn\\'t have a lens like this, from what I can find.  \\n\\n\\nFor Canon, I could also consider the 18-135 f/3.5-5.6 IS and an SL2, SL3, T6i, T7i, etc.  Of course, that leaves the upper end to solve.   \\n\\n\\ntl;dr:  I have a camera, I don\\'t have a lot invested it in.  I can change brands and consider anything.   Maybe suggest the right lens for what I want to do, and I\\'ll pick a body from there?    \\n\\n\\nThanks for the help.. I am a pilot as well as a golf coach. I take A LOT of pictures with my Iphone. Problem is, I don\\'t have optical zoom so I either have to get pictures from far away, get awkwardly close, or deal with awful digitally zoomed photos. \\nI would really like to get a camera that would connect to my phone in some way. Ideally the camera would hold the original image on itself and send a slightly more compact (Iphone picture size), to my camera roll. \\nLooking around it appears that there are cameras that connect to their own app, but not with this kind of functionality. I am hoping maybe someone here can point me in the right direction. \\nPrice isn\\'t a huge concern. Would like to keep it around or less than $800\\nI just want something that can zoom 30x or more, can take a picture of a slow moving airplane (60-80mph) or a golfer swinging a club (80-110 mph) without blur, and load a 14Mb ~ image to my  iphone camera roll without doing anything. \\nThanks\\n\\nEdit: Wow, great subreddit! I have opted to go with a cheapish B500 and see how it goes. I\\'ll have a chance to shoot some photos over the next couple days. Hoping its what I\\'m looking for. \\n\\nUpdate! Took a ton of pictures during a tournament this weekend. Was able to almost instantly post 2Mb versions the photos to twitter/ instagram etc after taking. Quality of picture is, in my little experience, better than that of my iPhone 6s and the 40x zoom was a total game changer. I was able to add all the pictures to iCloud storage and the players were loving them! Here are a few example photos! Thanks guys \\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/qCxNz\\n.

Hi Everyone,\\n\\nI feel like this question has probably been answered but I can’t seem to find a recent answer (with firmware updates/MB-V). I’ve been shooting Canon for a while, and all my glass is Canon. I’m planning on picking up an a7Riii in the next couple of days, and I’m wondering if those who’ve made a similar switch could tell me about the adapters they’re using?\\n\\nAll the stores I’ve walked into are pitching the MC-11, but most reviewers are pitching MB-V (can’t be sure if they’re sponsored or not).\\n\\nI mostly shoot street and some architecture, both occasionally in low light situations.\\n\\nCurrent glass:\\nSigma 50 f1.4 dg hsm \\nCanon 50 f1.8, 24-70 f4, 16-35 f4\\n. As the title says i\\'m looking for a good wide angle lens for my canon 80d. I\\'m looking right now at a used tokina 11-16 mm f/2.8 dx ii but i know that the Tokina ATX-I 11-16 F2.8 just came out and its about 200 buck more. I\\'m curious if anyone has any info about if the updated version is better for the 200? Iv been doing research online already but cant find much info comparing the two. Most people seem to say its just a new housing and very minor coating improvements but no one seems to have a solid answer. I\\'m curious if anyone here has any thoughts?. My fiancé and I are planning a honeymoon to Tokyo, Singapore and Bali in September. woohoo! I am so excited!\\n\\nI really want to document the trip and my little iPhone just doesn\\'t make the cut. I am an artist but I don\\'t have much experience with professional cameras. I think once I get the hang of it, I will have no problem but I want something that is relatively simple to use but still  can give me better images. I will be keeping a blog and want to update with images and have it be as simple as possible. This my be a stupid question but, are there cameras that can sync to my phone via bluetooth to download images? That would be a bonus but not necessary. \\n\\nI need a good camera anyway, because I am a stylist and could benefit from better client \"before and after\" photos. \\n\\nAny advice, tips, recommendations are greatly appreciated! \\nThanks y\\'all!\\n<3 Ashley. Hi everyone, 1st post ever on Reddit, exciting!\\n\\nI\\'m looking for advice as I\\'m planning to update/upgrade my gear, hope this is the right place to post this.\\n\\nBackground info:\\n\\nI\\'ve had my current Nikon D80 for +8 years, along with the following lenses:\\n\\n\\\\- AFS Nikkor 50mm 1.8G\\n\\n\\\\-  Nikkor 20mm f/2.8 (manual)\\n\\n\\\\-  AF Zoom- Nikkor 70-300mm f/4-5.6G (No VR)\\n\\nI\\'m an architect, & the primary reason to upgrade my gear is to shoot my finished projects **(need ultrawide)** & document ongoing project site visits **(need lightweight)**. The secondary reason to is shoot urban/interior/architectural photos as a hobby **(need wide & lightweight)**.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter doing some research, I\\'ve narrowed my options down to the following:\\n\\n**A-** Buy only Tokia 11-16  f/2,8 Pro DX-II Lens **(400$)**\\n\\n*Pros:* Low investment, ultrawide\\n\\n*Cons*: Cropped frame, Keeping the outdated D80, not a lightweight setup (especially when shooting interiors), lens will be useless if I upgrade to an FX camera in the future.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**B-** Buy Nikon D610 & Nikkor 12-24 f2.8 **OR** Nikkor 16-35 f4.0 **(1800 to 2600$)**\\n\\n*Pros:* Full frame new camera, best of available Nikkor ultrawide lenses\\n\\n*Cons:* High investment, heavy setup (not mobile enough)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**C-** Buy FujiFilm x100F &  wide converter (wcl-x100ii) **(\\\\~1500$)**\\n\\nPros: Very lightweight setup, point & shoot\\n\\nCons: Not ultrawide enough, not upgradable, never used P&S or Fuji.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhich scenario do you think will suit my needs? or is there any other setup you\\'d reccomend me to look into?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThanks in advance!\\n\\n## \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n## \\n\\n&#x200B;. Hi everyone. \\n\\nI know as much as the next guy about cameras. \\n\\nThere is a 16 year old kid in my youth group that has taken in photography as a new hobby. He is pretty good! He has always been pretty artsy... Likes to draw, etc. He has been using his iPhone for some shots and has been hanging out with a friend of mine who is a professional photographer. I asked him for suggestions and am waiting for a response. \\n\\nAnyway, I\\'d like to buy him a camera. Nothing too expensive, but something that he can learn with and take impressive pictures with. Maybe a Max of $300 for a budget?\\n\\nThanks for your suggestions!. Full disclosure - I know literally nothing about cameras.\\n\\nA little over a year ago I bought this camera: http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Alpha-Interchangeable-Camera-16-50mm/dp/B00HNJWU3G. It\\'s a nice camera I bought on a whim so I\\'d have something for my honeymoon. Two things I realized relatively quickly were that a) I hated lugging around a bigger camera (requires a over the shoulder small carrying bag) b) I hated taking off a lens cover every time I wanted to use it c) I don\\'t take a lot of \"high quality photos\" (mostly just for memories, etc) and d) I do enjoy taking video (this worked nicely for that with a flip up screen and good video quality. I found myself grabbing my iPhone instead of a camera because lugging a bigger camera was just unappealing.\\n\\nI was just watching a casey neistat video about this camera http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Optical-Full-HD/dp/B00EFILNV8 and it made me wish I had a point and shoot, or at least something I could pocket.\\n\\nMy question: Should I sell the A5000 on eBay and get a smaller point and shoot that fits my needs better? What am I giving up? How big of a difference on the photo side of things is this?\\n\\nI\\'d prefer to spend $0, aka I\\'d want to sell this A5000 and use what I made to buy a replacement.\\n\\nHappy to edit this with more info if needed, but I\\'m so incompetent I don\\'t even know what would be helpful :).\\n\\n. Hiya - I am considering buying a proper camera, but I have zero idea where to begin looking. Currently I am using an iPhone 6s for my photography needs, so obviously it needs to be better than that (I\\'m guessing that isn\\'t too hard). I tend to prefer taking fairly lowlight photos, as well as trying to take pictures of sunsets. So something geared towards that would be ideal. I also have a bunch of animals, so if it can handle jittery movement that would be great, but less important than the first. Video isn\\'t my thing, so no need for it to be great at that. And now for the tricky part: I happen to be a tiny, weak female with joint problems. I\\'ve figured out that this probably means a mirrorless is the way to go, but which one? Ideally it needs to be a max of 500 grams including lens and the less the better. Any suggestions?\\n\\nEDIT: I ended up getting a Fujifilm X-T20 + XC 16-50mm lens (II version). At 578 grams it is a little bit heavier than I had hoped, but seems like an okay compromise between quality, price, weight and ease of use.. Hi beautiful people,\\n  \\nI need some help finding the perfect camera for my dad. He\\'s 64 and loves to travel. I want him to truly enjoy filming and taking photos through his travels. I told him why not use your phone, however he\\'s persistent on buying a good camera. I support that.\\n  \\nHe will be visiting China, India, and few European countries.\\n  \\nI think main requirements are:  \\n- Better quality than phone.  \\n- WiFi/NFC/BlueTooth to send to phone  \\n- Video Recording  \\n- 4K resolution  \\n  \\nBudget: $600\\n  \\n  \\nSo far I think the Panasonic Lumix FZ80 is a decent choice, but I\\'m not an expert with cameras.\\n\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Camera-Megapixels-20-1200mm-F2-8-5-9/dp/B01MS16V42\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n**UPDATE: What do you guys think about these two my dad sent me:**  \\nhttps://www.kijiji.ca/v-camera-camcorder-lens/city-of-toronto/powerful-canon-powershot-sx720hs-40x-optical-zoom-wifi-camera/1340088908\\n  \\nhttps://www.kijiji.ca/v-camera-camcorder-lens/markham-york-region/nikon-coolpix-p600-16-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/1340284001. Hi /r/cameras,\\n\\nLooking into buying my first camera for a step above my current iPhone photography. Pretty set on getting a Sony Alpha A6000 because of good reviews from friends and the price/portability. \\n\\nHowever, after reading reviews online, I\\'ve heard scathing things about the 16-50mm kit lens, and suggestions to replace it with a Sigma 30mm f/2.8. Should I get the body only and get that lens instead? Basically, am I missing out by never even touching the kit lens? I was also considering the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 but it\\'s definitely a step up price (and size) wise from the other two. \\n\\nBody only: $400\\n16-50mm kit: $150\\nSigma 30mm F/2.8: $170\\n\\nThanks for the help.. Hey Hey , In have had this camera since July. Im so impressed with the quality I have shot 60 gigs of content so far. I got this camera so I did not have to use my phone, & so I\\'m not upset if it gets destroyed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt does 1080P@60fps and will shoot 16mp images @ 7 photos per Second!!!\\n\\n\\n[Xiaomi Yi Action Camera Accessories English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeGBM_Ei2_0)\\n\\n\\nAmbarella A7LS Processor\\n\\n\\nSony Exmor R BSI CMOS 16 million pixel sensor\\n\\n\\n155 degree (Mobile Phone 89 degree) wide angle lens\\n\\n\\n3D noise reduction\\n\\n\\nWiFi connectivity (up to 100 meters)\\n\\n\\nBLE ultra-low power consumption\\n\\n\\nWIFI and remote App control\\n\\n\\n4 Operating modes include: Photo, time-lapse photo, timed photo \\nand video\\n\\n\\nUltra compact and lightweight design\\n\\n\\nDetachable battery\\n\\n\\n\\nXiaomi is really great with updates aswell.\\n\\n\\n\\nI hope this post helps if you are in need of a new cam :)\\n\\n\\n[Mirror Maze - Xiaomi Yi Action Cam Dark Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHI7RHaADeo)\\n\\n\\n[Ghoster Coaster Canada\\'s Wonderland - Xiaomi Yi 60fps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N34BjuPxuI)\\n\\n. IPhone cameras, not that great for timelapses when you only have a 16 gig version.. Hey everyone. I just need a few opinions. Think of it like you were in my shoes what would you do.\\n\\nI am currently a video person. I have a bmcc, bmpcc and a c300. All these have an EF mount and I have a decent amount of EF mount lens.\\n\\nI am looking into buying a DSLR for fashion photography(Personal Project). That\\'s pretty much all I am going to use the camera for. Now the current undisputed champion is the Nikon D800/810.\\n\\nI know megapixels isn\\'t the factor of what makes a good picture but in fashion it\\'s great to have 36.3mp(D800/D810). Now I know 20.2 (6D/5D) mp isnt a slouch.\\n\\nMy mind is running in overdrive thinking about this. I have Canon lens that can be used on the cameras. I would buy the 24 1.2, 50 1.2 and the 85 1.2 at a later time. Those are the 3 lens I want either for Canon or Nikon. Just 1.4 in the Nikon version.\\n\\nNow, I am looking here is what I am debating:\\n\\nI have lens to use for the time being and wont have to get some till probably next year. Nikon I would have to get a lens. Probably the 85 1.4 or the 50 1.4.\\nThe 5D III is a great camera but for around the price of the D800 with 16 less megapixels. \\nD800 is a great camera but has been updated to the D810. Most cameras online dont have warranty. \\nThe D810 is $300 dollars more then the 5D III. Thats pretty much the cost of a lens.\\nThe D600 is 24mp but have to deal with the oil spot problem. I know most are fixed but dont want to test my luck.\\nThe D610 is also 24mp and is 300 dollars less then most used D800. But I would need to go buy lens.\\nThe 6d is about the same as the D610 but is 4 less mp. I know big deal and I wont have to buy lens but AF system is rubbish and 1 cross type point.\\nLast but not least both the D610 and the 6D have a max shutter speed of 1/4000th and the flash sync speed is less then 1/250th. I believe 1/180th. I do want to throw on some flash and use strobes so a kick in the nuts especially if I forget my ND filters at home on a bright day.  \\n\\nI am leaning towards the D800 but I have all those going through my mind. I know I am over thinking this but can\\'t make a final decision. Please no fan boy replies.. I am really pulling my hair out over this. what would you do?\\n\\n\\nThanks. . Hey guys,\\n\\nKind of a random question, but just posting to ask if it\\'s possible to put or convert a video from another camera (in this case an iPhone camera) onto a Canon t3i and have it play back on the camera\\'s LCD when going through the SD card loaded onto the camera?  I want to surprise a friend by loading a video onto her camera via an SD card, but I don\\'t have the camera with me currently, so I\\'d have to use my phone for now.  I was able to use the camera earlier however, and when I tried copying an iPhone video on the SD card, it either came up as incompatible, or didn\\'t show up altogether.  This was even after I tried converting it to an h.264 .mov in MPEG Streamclip to attempt to match the camera\\'s video recording format, and named it appropriately in the recorded videos\\' sequence on the card (i.e. MVI_1234, etc.).  So essentially, can I play back foreign video on a t3i, and if so, how should I convert it prior to copying it to the SD card?  Thanks so much in advance ––  I\\'ve pasted the format of the t3i video and iPhone video (from MPEG Streamclip) for reference if it helps!\\n\\n\\nt3i: \\n\\nStream: MVI_3634.MOV\\nPath: /Volumes/EOS_DIGITAL/DCIM/100CANON/MVI_3634.MOV\\n\\nDuration: 0:00:03\\nData Size: 13.15 MB\\nBit Rate: 35.26 Mbps\\n\\nVideo Tracks:\\nH.264, 1920 × 1080, 23.976 fps, 33.73 Mbps\\n\\nAudio Tracks:\\n16-bit Little Endian stereo, 48 kHz, 1.54 Mbps\\n\\nStream Files:\\nMVI_3634.MOV (13.15 MB)\\n\\n\\niPhone:\\n\\nStream: IMG_0433.MOV\\nPath: ~/Desktop/IMG_0433.MOV\\n\\nDuration: 0:01:46\\nData Size: 310.54 MB\\nBit Rate: 24.45 Mbps\\n\\nVideo Tracks:\\nH.264, 1920 × 1080, 29.975 fps, 24.39 Mbps\\n\\nAudio Tracks:\\nMPEG-4 Audio mono, 44.1 kHz, 63 kbps\\n\\nStream Files:\\nIMG_0433.MOV (310.54 MB)'"
